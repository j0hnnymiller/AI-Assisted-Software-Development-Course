00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:02.102
<v Tarrants, Seth>OK, welcome back.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/94-0
00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.142
<v John Miller>So we talked about, um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/96-0
00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:14.382
<v John Miller>Uh, two of these instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/100-0
00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:18.400
<v John Miller>And so I'm gonna talk about the other two
as well,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/100-1
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.422
<v John Miller>and then we'll generate some instruction,
some instruction files from that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/101-0
00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:26.062
<v John Miller>So uh, going back to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/103-0
00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:30.702
<v John Miller>Our um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/105-0
00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:33.902
<v John Miller>Oh, let that report the other one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/107-0
00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:41.942
<v John Miller>Many repos.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/110-0
00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:50.142
<v John Miller>All right, so we talked about these two.
What I wanted to show was that in.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/115-0
00:00:56.982 --> 00:01:05.948
<v John Miller>That the instruction file for AI assisted
output is specifying that we want to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/115-1
00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:10.942
<v John Miller>create a a log file or a log of all of
our.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/121-0
00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:19.352
<v John Miller>Of our actions with with with GitHub.
So we talked about the generated front</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/121-1
00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:25.388
<v John Miller>matter and it talks about this is kind of
a tricky subject or tricky issue with</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/121-2
00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:31.198
<v John Miller>this process is I wanted to record the
model that was used in the prompt and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/121-3
00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:33.462
<v John Miller>that's not actually available.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/125-0
00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:39.724
<v John Miller>from the model itself.
So I'm going to talk about the copilot</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/125-1
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:44.471
<v John Miller>instructions.
I'll get a little bit into that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/125-2
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:49.622
<v John Miller>So here we get into the chat logging of
the model.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/126-0
00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:53.182
<v John Miller>And let me open this so we can see the
whole thing.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/128-0
00:01:56.862 --> 00:01:57.102
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/131-0
00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:05.700
<v John Miller>So we want to make sure that we have a
chat transcript and put this into our AI</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/131-1
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.702
<v John Miller>logs folder.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/136-0
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:12.064
<v John Miller>We don't want to override any existing
conversation files,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/136-1
00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:16.125
<v John Miller>so we have a base folder.
We have an AI logs that's in a year,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/136-2
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:21.088
<v John Miller>month and date format with a chat ID,
which is basically kind of the name of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/136-3
00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:23.022
<v John Miller>the conversation itself. It's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/139-0
00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:31.936
<v John Miller>And so you have you end up with a a a
conversation, an MD file, a summary file,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/139-1
00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:36.742
<v John Miller>and then potentially an artifacts file as
well and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/144-0
00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:46.029
<v John Miller>The the contents of the the the file
should be the chat ID, when it started,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/144-1
00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:54.536
<v John Miller>the entire transcript and some the AI log
and the scaffold the AI logs structure</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/144-2
00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:57.582
<v John Miller>and when it's first executed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/146-0
00:02:57.782 --> 00:03:02.182
<v John Miller>And then here we talk about what goes
into the log.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/147-0
00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.822
<v John Miller>And what the exchange would look like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/149-0
00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:09.822
<v John Miller>And what the summary file should look
like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/151-0
00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:14.302
<v John Miller>And a secondary work key decisions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/155-0
00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:23.425
<v John Miller>Decision titles.
So it's a fairly comprehensive log of the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/155-1
00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:28.542
<v John Miller>Here's an example of what the summary log
might look like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/159-0
00:03:30.662 --> 00:03:35.695
<v John Miller>And then here at the end,
there's a quality check to verify that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/159-1
00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:41.270
<v John Miller>the that when when a artifact is
generated that all of these things are</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/159-2
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.742
<v John Miller>actually in effect.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/163-0
00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:49.360
<v John Miller>And then there is a a a chat
initialization for the chat like</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/163-1
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.575
<v John Miller>lifecycle that basically kicks off the
whole process and a file generation</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/163-2
00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:58.062
<v John Miller>workflow, some error handling.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/165-0
00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:03.210
<v John Miller>Uh,
some integration points into VS Studio.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/165-1
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.662
<v John Miller>How to how to create the chat ID?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/171-0
00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:13.113
<v John Miller>The enforcement that would go into CI to
to make sure that you don't check in a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/171-1
00:04:13.113 --> 00:04:19.083
<v John Miller>file that doesn't have this and then some
remediation if you are going to apply</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/171-2
00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:23.711
<v John Miller>this to existing files.
So if we look at the project there is</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/171-3
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.622
<v John Miller>here a log files from work that we did.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/175-0
00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:31.912
<v John Miller>That I did in this in this project
earlier.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/175-1
00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:35.721
<v John Miller>This is in the AI assisted development
project.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/175-2
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:40.322
<v John Miller>You can here is the validate improve
instruction section.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/175-3
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.782
<v John Miller>Here's the conversation ID log.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/179-0
00:04:43.862 --> 00:04:49.426
<v John Miller>The date the model that was used and this
model, since this was retrofitted,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/179-1
00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:54.267
<v John Miller>the survival was created.
Actually this chat session was initiated</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/179-2
00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:57.735
<v John Miller>before.
It's using a default model which is not</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/179-3
00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.542
<v John Miller>the actual correct model.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/183-0
00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:05.998
<v John Miller>And that's that's a a a problem.
It actually may cause me to to to remove</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/183-1
00:05:05.998 --> 00:05:12.702
<v John Miller>this feature because it's not as reliable
as I'd like it to be. Here's the actual.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/187-0
00:05:14.102 --> 00:05:17.943
<v John Miller>Exchange.
Here's the text that I I I executed,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/187-1
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:23.910
<v John Miller>so I'm asking it to evaluate and approve
the instruction file. Run this,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/187-2
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.142
<v John Miller>run this particular prompt and this was
the gist of the output.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/191-0
00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:39.350
<v John Miller>Here I am telling it to run face one of a
branch creation and setup exercise and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/191-1
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.985
<v John Miller>prompt.
Here's prompt 3 where I'm actually asking</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/191-2
00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:45.662
<v John Miller>it to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/194-0
00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:52.332
<v John Miller>Perform that the direct validation and
then chat for I'm getting a result pack</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/194-1
00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:56.862
<v John Miller>that's telling that that is complete.
Here's a mistake.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/197-0
00:05:58.582 --> 00:06:02.692
<v John Miller>And then it completed some fixes and
reported back.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/197-1
00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:05.142
<v John Miller>So this is the the idea of the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/201-0
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:11.823
<v John Miller>Of the conversation log and here is an
example of what a summary file would look</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/201-1
00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:15.328
<v John Miller>like.
Notice that this file has six steps that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/201-2
00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:20.102
<v John Miller>it wanted to execute,
which was option C here and then we have.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/205-0
00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:25.255
<v John Miller>Two other steps that that could be
executed and completed,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/205-1
00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:31.157
<v John Miller>which is regenerate the instruction files
and validate the improvements and the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/205-2
00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:35.142
<v John Miller>idea is that I could then add this file
into my chat.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/209-0
00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:42.553
<v John Miller>Like summary dot MD and then I can then
tell it to go ahead and resume the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/209-1
00:06:42.553 --> 00:06:49.264
<v John Miller>process at that point and it will pick up
with the option 5 and and continue to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/209-2
00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:50.942
<v John Miller>execute that prompt.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/214-0
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:58.691
<v John Miller>So so the so this gives us I think 2 main
2 main values and one is the audit trail</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/214-1
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:05.552
<v John Miller>and logging and the 2nd is this ability
to resume and and the the resume feature</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/214-2
00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:11.142
<v John Miller>is particularly important because as you
continue to work in the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/218-0
00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:17.856
<v John Miller>The context continues to grow until the
point that you've exceeded the window and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/218-1
00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:23.834
<v John Miller>now you start to forget things.
So this allows you to go and start a new</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/218-2
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.782
<v John Miller>chat, bring in the summary file and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/221-0
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:32.197
<v John Miller>And then go ahead and resume it from that
point and you get a a clear context at</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/221-1
00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:35.974
<v John Miller>that at that stage.
Any any comments or questions on this so</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/221-2
00:07:35.974 --> 00:07:36.222
<v John Miller>far?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/223-0
00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:43.502
<v John Miller>That's correct.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/226-0
00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:46.822
<v John Miller>That's correct. That's correct, yes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/225-0
00:07:43.742 --> 00:07:44.742
<v Harding, Mike>Zoom from this file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/232-0
00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:53.686
<v John Miller>Well, well, actually, no,
I'm not sure about that because you're</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/232-1
00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:58.108
<v John Miller>resuming it from the the session file.
It has an ID,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/232-2
00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:04.700
<v John Miller>so it may it may be able to actually pick
up where it lists off. To be honest,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/232-3
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.702
<v John Miller>I I haven't.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/234-0
00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:10.439
<v John Miller>I even tested that resume feature except
for a couple of times and so I'm still</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/234-1
00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.742
<v John Miller>experimenting with it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/235-0
00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:12.382
<v Harding, Mike>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/241-0
00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:18.796
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>John,
could you elaborate on the syntax of of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/241-1
00:08:18.796 --> 00:08:24.266
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>this of the instruction file? What?
What are the rules or where they're</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/241-2
00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:28.444
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>coming from?
Is it textual or if I would like to start</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/239-0
00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:28.662
<v John Miller>It's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/241-3
00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:32.622
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>writing one from scratch as opposed to
modifying your?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/242-0
00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:35.662
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Your examples. How would I go about it?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/245-0
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:43.462
<v John Miller>So my suggestion would be that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/251-0
00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:51.967
<v John Miller>That we would create an.
What I've done is I create an instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/251-1
00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:57.926
<v John Miller>file for creating instruction files.
It applies to only files that have</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/251-2
00:08:57.926 --> 00:09:01.982
<v John Miller>instructions dot MD at the end of them
and then.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/249-0
00:09:01.022 --> 00:09:01.502
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Mhm.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/255-0
00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:07.041
<v John Miller>It then it builds the structure for me
and it and defines it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/255-1
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:11.666
<v John Miller>There is no really required structure.
It's all free text.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/255-2
00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:17.702
<v John Miller>It can be whatever you that you want to
put in it, so it can be very simple.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/259-0
00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:22.669
<v John Miller>Or it can be, you know,
as elaborate as some of these are.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/259-1
00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:27.058
<v John Miller>This is what I used this instruction file
to create.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/259-2
00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:33.519
<v John Miller>It's intended to create a MARP slides,
and MARP slides are a markdown version</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/259-3
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.182
<v John Miller>that is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/264-0
00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:40.158
<v John Miller>Useful for creating slides and I like to
use it because it allows me to actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/264-1
00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:45.735
<v John Miller>apply AI to the slide generation process
and do a lot of interesting things like</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/264-2
00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:50.142
<v John Miller>add speaker notes automatically and
generate slides on the fly.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/268-0
00:09:51.782 --> 00:09:55.354
<v John Miller>But anyway,
this is just as an example of what the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/268-1
00:09:55.354 --> 00:10:00.957
<v John Miller>what it looks like and so here you can
see what the required front matter would</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/268-2
00:10:00.957 --> 00:10:04.740
<v John Miller>be that it's asking to get the top of the
slide file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/268-3
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.102
<v John Miller>It's what the what a slide skeleton looks
like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/269-0
00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:08.782
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/270-0
00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:14.142
<v John Miller>O Here's an example slide.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/273-0
00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.702
<v John Miller>Some authoring rules checklists.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/276-0
00:10:20.502 --> 00:10:26.067
<v John Miller>Some copilot specific guidance.
These are all useful.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/276-1
00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:29.262
<v John Miller>All things are coming from the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/277-0
00:10:30.342 --> 00:10:31.942
<v John Miller>The instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/278-0
00:10:33.182 --> 00:10:33.862
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>OK. Thank you.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/281-0
00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:40.586
<v John Miller>So yeah,
so you can do that really very easily if</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/281-1
00:10:40.586 --> 00:10:42.302
<v John Miller>we go back to our.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/284-0
00:10:43.982 --> 00:10:50.142
<v John Miller>Our our test folder. Where?
Where did that go?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/288-0
00:10:51.222 --> 00:10:57.264
<v John Miller>I think that's this guy here we can say
and this is a a a a really useful</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/288-1
00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:02.653
<v John Miller>technique because we have an empty
project that does not have any</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/288-2
00:11:02.653 --> 00:11:07.062
<v John Miller>instruction files in it.
So we we could actually say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/290-0
00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:12.782
<v John Miller>Create instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/292-0
00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:16.822
<v John Miller>For this project.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/295-0
00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:25.199
<v John Miller>And it will actually go through and look
at the the project.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/295-1
00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:28.542
<v John Miller>It'll evaluate the the the technology and
the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/300-0
00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:34.199
<v John Miller>The contents of the project and and
generate instruction files for that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/300-1
00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:39.090
<v John Miller>And which I think interesting about these
instruction files to create is that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/300-2
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.853
<v John Miller>they're not actually targeted to the
actual implementation,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/300-3
00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.302
<v John Miller>it's really targeted towards the
technology that it's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/302-0
00:11:47.342 --> 00:11:53.131
<v John Miller>That you're using,
so it's possible that the code that you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/302-1
00:11:53.131 --> 00:11:53.622
<v John Miller>have.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/305-0
00:11:55.382 --> 00:12:00.005
<v John Miller>In your in your project at the time will
not comply with the instruction files</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/305-1
00:12:00.005 --> 00:12:00.942
<v John Miller>that it creates.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/308-0
00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:11.327
<v John Miller>So let's see what it's done so far.
Insistent on instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/308-1
00:12:11.327 --> 00:12:13.582
<v John Miller>This is a providing instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/310-0
00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:17.302
<v John Miller>For the assistance.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/315-0
00:12:21.062 --> 00:12:27.052
<v John Miller>And so these are basically looking at
since we've been doing a lot of actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/315-1
00:12:27.052 --> 00:12:33.345
<v John Miller>no, I've been better if I you're on text.
Let me undo this and continue because we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/315-2
00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.302
<v John Miller>were doing all this conversation about.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/317-0
00:12:38.982 --> 00:12:44.582
<v John Miller>About buffering and and managing the the
the the the prompt buffer.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/320-0
00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:52.622
<v John Miller>Uh, instead of saying just that,
we'll say that for the technology.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/330-0
00:13:03.862 --> 00:13:09.825
<v John Miller>And the idea here is that we're looking
for guidance on how we should actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/330-1
00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:13.600
<v John Miller>write code.
Other ways you can other ways you can</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/330-2
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.676
<v John Miller>structure this prompt.
You could say I want to create</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/330-3
00:13:17.676 --> 00:13:19.262
<v John Miller>instruction file for.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/332-0
00:13:19.462 --> 00:13:25.862
<v John Miller>C# looks at a so far as identified C#,
the.net SDK, WPF and end unit.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/337-0
00:13:28.582 --> 00:13:34.736
<v John Miller>And so now we have a instruction file for
C# and notice that it has an apply to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/337-1
00:13:34.736 --> 00:13:39.736
<v John Miller>clause that says this instruction file
only applies to C# files,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/337-2
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:43.582
<v John Miller>so this will help keep the context from
bloating.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/340-0
00:13:44.662 --> 00:13:49.776
<v John Miller>By not including it,
if it's evaluating something that's not</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/340-1
00:13:49.776 --> 00:13:55.142
<v John Miller>C# code, then it has a.net instructions,
any unit instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/342-0
00:13:56.742 --> 00:13:58.822
<v John Miller>And in WPF instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/344-0
00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:03.559
<v John Miller>And if we were to look at, let's say,
just the C# instructions,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/344-1
00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.342
<v John Miller>let's take a closer look at this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/349-0
00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:15.511
<v John Miller>And so it's providing concise actual
guidance on editing C# source codes in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/349-1
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:19.658
<v John Miller>this repository. It wants to follow the.
net naming conventions,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/349-2
00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:23.677
<v John Miller>keep methods small and focused,
use expression bodied members,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/349-3
00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:26.102
<v John Miller>prefer immutable code, immutable data.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/354-0
00:14:28.102 --> 00:14:33.547
<v John Miller>Avoid region blocks unless grouping is
necessary for very large files.</v>

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:38.916
<v John Miller>File names and that's primary public type
names and shared utilities,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/354-2
00:14:38.916 --> 00:14:43.902
<v John Miller>formatting and styling.
I don't like 4 spaces, I would prefer 2.</v>

00:14:44.822 --> 00:14:46.942
<v John Miller>Error handling.</v>

00:14:48.382 --> 00:14:52.531
<v John Miller>Validation exceptions to specific

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/360-1
00:14:52.531 --> 00:14:58.836
<v John Miller>New public behavior must include unit
tests in the calculator dot test project</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/360-2
00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:04.582
<v John Miller>and keep tests isolated and deterministic.
Avoid flaky timing behavior.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/364-0
00:15:04.902 --> 00:15:09.874
<v John Miller>And then it makes a reference to the.

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/364-1
00:15:09.874 --> 00:15:16.233
<v John Miller>which is an external file that it's
actually going to ask it to fetch and use</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/364-2
00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:19.902
<v John Miller>for naming things.
So any questions on this?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/366-0
00:15:23.982 --> 00:15:27.182
<v John Miller>So in my mind, it's happy.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/370-0
00:15:24.822 --> 00:15:29.604
<v Majernik, Peter>I I feel like I should ask a question.
Did this does?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/370-1
00:15:29.604 --> 00:15:35.979
<v Majernik, Peter>Does everybody understand what what to do
with these instruction files?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/370-2
00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.902
<v Majernik, Peter>Because I'm a little bit lost so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/375-0
00:15:37.222 --> 00:15:39.976
<v John Miller>Well, well,
we that's because we really haven't</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/375-1
00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:43.188
<v John Miller>applied them.
So let's which we'll do that next, right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/371-0
00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:43.822
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, OK, so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/375-2
00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:46.860
<v John Miller>You just created them.
And the idea here is this is like a like</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/375-3
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.393
<v John Miller>a when you're starting with a new project,
this is in my mind one of the first</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/375-4
00:15:51.393 --> 00:15:52.942
<v John Miller>things that you want to do.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/379-0
00:15:53.462 --> 00:15:57.872
<v John Miller>If you're working with existing code and
you want to start to use AI to help you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/379-1
00:15:57.872 --> 00:16:01.030
<v John Miller>write that code,
the first thing you want to do, I think,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/379-2
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.896
<v John Miller>is to create these instruction files
because they tell the AI what the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/379-3
00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:09.306
<v John Miller>expectations are for when it generates
code and that's gives us the control that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/379-4
00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:09.742
<v John Miller>we need.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/380-0
00:16:10.062 --> 00:16:12.566
<v John Miller>To produce the output that we expect,
right?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/380-1
00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:15.182
<v John Miller>So it keeps us focused and keeps it in
target.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/384-0
00:16:13.062 --> 00:16:15.571
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so so the file that you have on the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/384-1
00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:18.645
<v Majernik, Peter>screen,
are those the instructions for the AI or</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/384-2
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.782
<v Majernik, Peter>are these the instructions AI gave to the
people?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/382-0
00:16:20.222 --> 00:16:20.582
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/388-0
00:16:22.062 --> 00:16:29.075
<v John Miller>No, these are the instructions for the AI.
It's AC sharp instruction file and it's</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/388-1
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:35.243
<v John Miller>applying only to CI sharp file.
So it is says when you generate A or you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/388-2
00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:37.102
<v John Miller>examine AC sharp file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/390-0
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:42.358
<v John Miller>You you should be looking at these
instructions as to guide you with that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/396-0
00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:45.046
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so now if I if I give the AI this file as</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/390-1
00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:43.062
<v John Miller>evaluation.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/396-1
00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:48.845
<v Majernik, Peter>a context and then I say OK,
generate AC sharp class for me,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/396-2
00:16:48.845 --> 00:16:53.828
<v Majernik, Peter>then it's gonna read all this and respect
the rules and it's gonna generate the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/393-0
00:16:51.702 --> 00:16:51.822
<v John Miller>Yep.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/394-0
00:16:53.622 --> 00:16:54.782
<v John Miller>Yep, Yep.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/396-3
00:16:53.828 --> 00:16:56.942
<v Majernik, Peter>beautiful class for me.
That's that's the result.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/403-0
00:16:56.502 --> 00:17:00.526
<v John Miller>Yes, that's the that's the idea.
It it will, it will,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/397-0
00:16:57.462 --> 00:16:57.582
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/403-1
00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:05.518
<v John Miller>it will refuse to do things that violate
these these instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/403-2
00:17:05.518 --> 00:17:09.691
<v John Miller>If you ask it to do,
if you ask it to do something that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/400-0
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:09.582
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/403-3
00:17:09.691 --> 00:17:14.609
<v John Miller>violates its instructions,
it will come back with a response that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/403-4
00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:14.982
<v John Miller>says.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/405-0
00:17:15.062 --> 00:17:17.989
<v John Miller>I'm not.
I'm not supposed to do this because of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/405-1
00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:22.137
<v John Miller>these instructions, right?
So this becomes like hard and fast rules</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/405-2
00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:23.662
<v John Miller>that you're giving to AI.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/411-0
00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:28.122
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so then the other area of confusion for</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/411-1
00:17:28.122 --> 00:17:32.833
<v Majernik, Peter>me is between, you know,
the free text and going to the other one</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/411-2
00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:36.117
<v Majernik, Peter>that looks like a language that I don't
know.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/411-3
00:17:36.117 --> 00:17:41.542
<v Majernik, Peter>Like when we looked at the copilot
instructions dot MD, there are a lot of.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/409-0
00:17:40.542 --> 00:17:40.582
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/412-0
00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:45.822
<v Majernik, Peter>Details in there that I don't just get by
looking at them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/419-0
00:17:47.142 --> 00:17:51.135
<v Majernik, Peter>So is is this something we are going to
dive into deeper again?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/414-0
00:17:49.662 --> 00:17:49.822
<v John Miller>Sure.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/419-1
00:17:51.135 --> 00:17:54.193
<v Majernik, Peter>Or I I just don't want to assume that,
you know,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/419-2
00:17:54.193 --> 00:17:58.062
<v Majernik, Peter>everybody got it and I'm the only one
missing the point here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/417-0
00:17:57.262 --> 00:17:57.502
<v John Miller>Sure.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/423-0
00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:01.265
<v John Miller>Oh,
that's it's that's it's great for you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/423-1
00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:04.103
<v John Miller>bringing that up.
So move this into new window.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/423-2
00:18:04.103 --> 00:18:09.070
<v John Miller>Another nice thing about the instruction
files is that you can they're marked down,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/423-3
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.022
<v John Miller>so you can actually present them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/426-0
00:18:13.102 --> 00:18:13.982
<v Majernik, Peter>Um, OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/425-0
00:18:13.142 --> 00:18:13.262
<v John Miller>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/428-0
00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:20.982
<v John Miller>So this is free text as well.
There's nothing I I think.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/433-0
00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:25.126
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so all the cryptic stuff I'm looking at,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/433-1
00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:28.192
<v Majernik, Peter>it's only markdown.
There is no other language embedded</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/431-0
00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:32.382
<v John Miller>No, no, no, no.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/433-2
00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:31.861
<v Majernik, Peter>within the markdown. No instructions,
nothing. It's free text. OK,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/433-3
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.942
<v Majernik, Peter>that's the part I was missing. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/436-0
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.894
<v John Miller>Right.
And and this instruction file can</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/434-0
00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:35.022
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/436-1
00:18:35.894 --> 00:18:39.462
<v John Miller>reference other instruction file that may
even do that towards the end.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/441-0
00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:45.756
<v John Miller>Naming conventions for files,
prompt file structure,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/441-1
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:51.204
<v John Miller>common mistakes to avoid.
The other another cool thing about this</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/441-2
00:18:51.204 --> 00:18:57.725
<v John Miller>is you could generate instruction files
and then do all the coding by hand and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/441-3
00:18:57.725 --> 00:19:00.862
<v John Miller>then it will and then you can compare.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/446-0
00:19:01.062 --> 00:19:06.142
<v John Miller>The code that you wrote against the
instruction files to make sure that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/446-1
00:19:06.142 --> 00:19:11.081
<v John Miller>you're complying with them,
and you suggested that we look at ways of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/446-2
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:16.655
<v John Miller>incorporating that into the CICD process.
But I would say that a good place to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/446-3
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.702
<v John Miller>apply this would be actually.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/449-0
00:19:18.902 --> 00:19:24.538
<v John Miller>When you try to create a PR so that if
you create a PR and it doesn't comply</v>

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:28.784
<v John Miller>with these instructions,
then add comments to the PR that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/449-2
00:19:28.784 --> 00:19:33.542
<v John Miller>recommend what changes you need to make
to go to the compliance.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/453-0
00:19:31.382 --> 00:19:36.763
<v Majernik, Peter>Now now I would I would love to see an
example of that being done.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/451-0
00:19:36.182 --> 00:19:38.622
<v John Miller>Yeah, look what? Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/453-1
00:19:36.763 --> 00:19:41.662
<v Majernik, Peter>How do I how do I create a PR that
enforces all these rules?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/459-0
00:19:42.422 --> 00:19:45.001
<v John Miller>Right.
Let's let's take a stab at that maybe</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/459-1
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:48.267
<v John Miller>this afternoon.
So you get a sense of that because I did</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/459-2
00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:52.623
<v John Miller>some experimenting while you guys were in
the call and and I made some good</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/459-3
00:19:52.623 --> 00:19:56.176
<v John Miller>progress with that.
So I think it's something that we can do.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/459-4
00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:58.182
<v John Miller>It wasn't exactly how I thought it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/456-0
00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:57.862
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/465-0
00:19:58.502 --> 00:20:00.947
<v John Miller>It wasn't exactly how I thought it would
work,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/458-0
00:19:59.022 --> 00:19:59.142
<v Majernik, Peter>But.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/465-1
00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:04.590
<v John Miller>but I think it's going to be something
that we can take advantage of.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/465-2
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.336
<v John Miller>And I can then see that you would have a
whole series of these kinds of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/465-3
00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:12.499
<v John Miller>instruction files that you want to do
some comparisons against in a PR and then</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/465-4
00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:16.662
<v John Miller>add comments that need to be addressed
before you can actually approve that PR.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/463-0
00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:17.942
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/469-0
00:20:18.182 --> 00:20:23.654
<v John Miller>All right, so all right. So yeah,
here was the references I was talking</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/469-1
00:20:23.654 --> 00:20:26.998
<v John Miller>about here.
It's referencing AI Providence.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/469-2
00:20:26.998 --> 00:20:30.418
<v John Miller>This is my personal instruction file,
right?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/469-3
00:20:30.418 --> 00:20:34.142
<v John Miller>So if I go into back to the main window
and say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/472-0
00:20:35.742 --> 00:20:42.662
<v John Miller>This is kind of interesting.
Show me the instruction.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/474-0
00:20:45.462 --> 00:20:48.542
<v John Miller>That are in.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/479-0
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:05.417
<v John Miller>And it should identify these four files
as well as anything else that's I've</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/479-1
00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:06.142
<v John Miller>referenced.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/481-0
00:21:11.382 --> 00:21:14.302
<v John Miller>In scope.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/483-0
00:21:13.302 --> 00:21:16.730
<v Majernik, Peter>And how, how,
how exactly did you add them to the scope?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/483-1
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:21.542
<v Majernik, Peter>Is it just the fact that it sits in the
repo or you actually attached them all?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/487-0
00:21:22.662 --> 00:21:26.815
<v John Miller>If you put them in the GitHub
instructions folder or this is where I</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/487-1
00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:31.571
<v John Miller>put them or anywhere in the under dot
GitHub and they have an instructions dot</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/487-2
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:34.942
<v John Miller>MD then that will be they'll be included
in your scope.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/489-0
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:38.507
<v Majernik, Peter>And and is that some regex that picks
them up or is this like some industry</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/489-1
00:21:38.507 --> 00:21:38.982
<v Majernik, Peter>standard?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/490-0
00:21:40.742 --> 00:21:43.822
<v John Miller>No,
I'd say it's kind of a GitHub copilot</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/491-0
00:21:43.622 --> 00:21:43.742
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/490-1
00:21:43.822 --> 00:21:44.262
<v John Miller>thing.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/497-0
00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:51.090
<v John Miller>So here you can see it's looking for star
dot instructions dot pro looking at</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/497-1
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:57.266
<v John Miller>different files here and so it's saying
is it here's the here's that where's the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/495-0
00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:56.182
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, that makes sense.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/497-2
00:21:57.266 --> 00:22:00.622
<v John Miller>one that I was looking for my personal
one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/498-0
00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:05.382
<v John Miller>So here it's found all of those.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/501-0
00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:09.582
<v John Miller>And don't see the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/502-0
00:22:11.582 --> 00:22:14.062
<v John Miller>Other instruction bot on the list.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/507-0
00:22:17.902 --> 00:22:22.487
<v John Miller>The other thing I know I've noticed this
popped up recently in that you can</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/507-1
00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:27.252
<v John Miller>whenever it's actually multiple steps,
it'll put a to do's thing up here and I</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/507-2
00:22:27.252 --> 00:22:31.355
<v John Miller>think there's a a tool that does this in
our tool section. Oh look,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/507-3
00:22:31.355 --> 00:22:32.622
<v John Miller>I've exceeded by 128.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/508-0
00:22:33.262 --> 00:22:34.702
<v John Miller>And that is this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/510-0
00:22:36.142 --> 00:22:36.222
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/512-0
00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:42.222
<v John Miller>Run task to do is right here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/516-0
00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:52.022
<v John Miller>And that allows that feature to come into
play and it'll like it allows you to keep</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/516-1
00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:54.599
<v John Miller>track.
But I was looking for my personal</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/516-2
00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:58.182
<v John Miller>instruction file and it doesn't seem to
be in this list.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/518-0
00:22:59.662 --> 00:23:02.982
<v John Miller>Sees the other ones.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/520-0
00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:06.622
<v John Miller>Oh no, here it is right there.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/524-0
00:23:09.422 --> 00:23:14.002
<v John Miller>So if I click on that then it opens that
file and here I can see that that's file</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/524-1
00:23:14.002 --> 00:23:18.246
<v John Miller>is located in my roaming folder and a
instruction that in the file and it's</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/524-2
00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:22.323
<v John Miller>found that and it's found that
instruction file and it's incorporated it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/524-3
00:23:22.323 --> 00:23:24.502
<v John Miller>and this has just some generic kind of.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/528-0
00:23:24.502 --> 00:23:31.708
<v John Miller>Things that you would want to in terms of
just kind of tuning how you interact with</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/528-1
00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:35.740
<v John Miller>copilot.
This is a a way that you can do a way</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/528-2
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.542
<v John Miller>that you can do that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/531-0
00:23:39.782 --> 00:23:45.291
<v Majernik, Peter>Do you have a recommended VS Code
extension to preview these empty files</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/531-1
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:47.102
<v Majernik, Peter>properly or more easily?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/532-0
00:23:46.022 --> 00:23:49.302
<v John Miller>I think it's others if we do it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/534-0
00:23:51.462 --> 00:23:52.542
<v Majernik, Peter>Or is it just built in?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/535-0
00:23:51.782 --> 00:23:53.062
<v John Miller>Go to extend.</v>

00:23:54.262 --> 00:23:56.542
<v John Miller>Just look search for our mark down.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/538-0
00:23:58.502 --> 00:24:00.696
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah,
I'm just wondering which one do you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/538-1
00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:01.062
<v Majernik, Peter>prefer?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/541-0
00:24:01.382 --> 00:24:05.008
<v John Miller>Well, let's see what do I have installed?
Marked.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/541-1
00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:09.142
<v John Miller>I have marked down all in one markdown
preview enhanced.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/544-0
00:24:10.662 --> 00:24:14.028
<v John Miller>Uh, markdown PDF conversion.
So I have looks like a quite a few</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/544-1
00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:17.288
<v John Miller>different ones. Oh no,
these are ones I don't have installed,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/544-2
00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:19.182
<v John Miller>but we're the ones I have installed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/546-0
00:24:23.742 --> 00:24:23.902
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/550-0

I was hoping to just right right click in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/548-0
00:24:31.622 --> 00:24:33.102
<v John Miller>There we go.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/550-1
00:24:34.382 --> 00:24:36.222
<v Majernik, Peter>VS code and say preview.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/552-0
00:24:37.702 --> 00:24:39.662
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's right. That's right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/557-0
00:24:44.022 --> 00:24:48.516
<v John Miller>So I have a mermaid support.
If you don't know what mermaid is,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/557-1
00:24:48.516 --> 00:24:51.886
<v John Miller>it's a diagramming language that's in
markdown.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/557-2
00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:56.521

<v John Miller>Yeah, and here's a linting.
So this will keep your markdown compliant</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/561-0
00:25:08.422 --> 00:25:08.862
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/565-1
00:25:10.413 --> 00:25:14.617
<v John Miller>and show you errors.
I have this mark one that I I was talking</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/565-2
00:25:14.617 --> 00:25:19.022
<v John Miller>about and then this one for syntax
highlighting a colon matching.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/570-0
00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:25.834
<v John Miller>So those are what I've been using.
So anyway, so this is the personal one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/570-1
00:25:25.834 --> 00:25:30.952
<v John Miller>I actually created this one by asking
Copilot to create me a personal a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/570-2
00:25:30.952 --> 00:25:36.640
<v John Miller>personal instruction file and this is
what it came up with and so far it's been</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/570-3
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.062
<v John Miller>working for me fine.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/572-0
00:25:38.422 --> 00:25:46.782
<v John Miller>I may tear this down just to to to keep
it sane, but let me see what I have here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/573-0
00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:50.702
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/576-0
00:25:54.102 --> 00:25:57.179
<v John Miller>All right.
So we'll get into that a little bit later</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/576-1
00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:57.702
<v John Miller>then. Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/581-0
00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:03.234
<v John Miller>So that here is our preview of the
copilot instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/581-1
00:26:03.234 --> 00:26:09.179
<v John Miller>The the primary use of this file is is to
try to manage what the current what the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/581-2
00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:12.877
<v John Miller>current model is.
So here you're looking at the AI</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/581-3
00:26:12.877 --> 00:26:14.182
<v John Miller>generated is true.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/585-0
00:26:15.902 --> 00:26:20.344
<v John Miller>What the actual model is,
and one of the things I found I learned</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/585-1
00:26:20.344 --> 00:26:24.315
<v John Miller>when I was trying to actually create this
logging feature.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/585-2
00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:29.632
<v John Miller>I had specified that I wanted to have the
model and it didn't understand right</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/585-3
00:26:29.632 --> 00:26:34.142
<v John Miller>exactly what I was asking for and the
more I drilled down into it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-0
00:26:34.382 --> 00:26:37.406
<v John Miller>It basically said no,
this is something that it said.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-1
00:26:37.406 --> 00:26:40.038
<v John Miller>I don't have that information available
to me,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-2
00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:44.686
<v John Miller>which I think is interesting is that when
you're running a prompt in Copilot right</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-3
00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:47.094
<v John Miller>now,
you don't know what model is actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-4
00:26:47.094 --> 00:26:50.118
<v John Miller>running it.
You know from the UI which one is running</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/590-5
00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:52.302
<v John Miller>it because that's the one you selected.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/592-0
00:26:52.662 --> 00:26:56.514
<v John Miller>But the AI doesn't know which model is
actually being executed at the time,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/592-1
00:26:56.514 --> 00:26:58.542
<v John Miller>which I thought was kind of interesting.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/594-0
00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:06.302
<v John Miller>All right,
so let let me search for defaults. Can I?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/597-0
00:27:13.062 --> 00:27:17.262
<v John Miller>Is it in here? Interesting.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/601-0
00:27:19.982 --> 00:27:25.000
<v John Miller>Must have renamed it,
but the idea here is that it there's a a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/601-1
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.062
<v John Miller>default model that's recorded in this
file and um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/605-0
00:27:30.742 --> 00:27:37.554
<v John Miller>You can then by upping that you can then
specify what the default model is when</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/605-1
00:27:37.554 --> 00:27:43.430
<v John Miller>you actually create a prompt,
and then when you create a prompt that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/605-2
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.262
<v John Miller>prompt will then use that specific model
so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/607-0
00:27:47.302 --> 00:27:47.822
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/612-0
00:27:47.302 --> 00:27:52.835
<v John Miller>One of the prompts that we'll talk about
in a bit is this prompt here,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/612-1
00:27:52.835 --> 00:27:58.913
<v John Miller>which is kind of interesting in that what
it tries to do is do a conflict and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/612-2
00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:02.498
<v John Miller>analysis detection of your instruction
files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/612-3
00:28:02.498 --> 00:28:06.862
<v John Miller>So it's going to look at the files in
your instruction.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/617-0
00:28:07.142 --> 00:28:12.107
<v John Miller>And it's going to do conflict resolution.
So it's going to look at all of them</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/617-1
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:16.885
<v John Miller>together as a whole and make sure that
there's no conflicting instructions,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/617-2
00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:20.656
<v John Miller>that there's no inconsistencies,
no logical contradictions,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/617-3
00:28:20.656 --> 00:28:24.742
<v John Miller>no scope and priority conflicts,
no technical incompatibilities.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-0
00:28:24.902 --> 00:28:27.705
<v John Miller>No communication gaps,
duplication or redundancy,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-1
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:30.957
<v John Miller>and then this is the report or the format
for each issue.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-2
00:28:30.957 --> 00:28:34.658
<v John Miller>So it will then look at those
instructions and spit out a list of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-3
00:28:34.658 --> 00:28:37.517
<v John Miller>issues that it finds with those
instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-4
00:28:37.517 --> 00:28:41.554
<v John Miller>And then you can go back to your
instruction files and fix them so that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/622-5
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:44.582
<v John Miller>they're consistent.
And the benefit of doing that is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/624-0
00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:52.353
<v John Miller>That you're not confusing the AI with
contradictions or inaccuracies.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/624-1
00:28:52.353 --> 00:28:54.342
<v John Miller>So this is a nice.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/630-0
00:28:55.782 --> 00:29:00.619
<v John Miller>Part of your your your the pre-process
before you're actually starting to do a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/630-1
00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:05.334
<v John Miller>lot of cogeneration is to make sure that
these instruction files that you're</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/630-2
00:29:05.334 --> 00:29:10.171
<v John Miller>creating and putting into your solution
are all consistent with each other and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/630-3
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:14.702
<v John Miller>don't have any any issues that would
cause the AI to not know what to do.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/631-0
00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:17.662
<v John Miller>Or have to make a decision on its own.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-0
00:29:21.062 --> 00:29:23.710
<v John Miller>So,
so I think one of the key takeaways is</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-1
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.591
<v John Miller>that these are they're all natural
language. They're all text.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-2
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:32.272
<v John Miller>It's something that the in effect,
in order for the AI to take advantage of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-3
00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:35.044
<v John Miller>it,
they have to do the same thing it has to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-4
00:29:35.044 --> 00:29:39.726
<v John Miller>do with your code or with any prop that
you give it. It has to tokenize it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/637-5
00:29:39.726 --> 00:29:40.342
<v John Miller>It has to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/639-0
00:29:40.582 --> 00:29:45.156
<v John Miller>into vectors that has to then add it to
your contacts window and that becomes</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/639-1
00:29:45.156 --> 00:29:49.848
<v John Miller>like part of what you it understands at
that moment in order for it to form the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/639-2
00:29:49.848 --> 00:29:50.142
<v John Miller>work.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/641-0
00:29:54.302 --> 00:29:56.102
<v John Miller>All right. Any questions on that?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/643-0
00:29:57.982 --> 00:29:58.062
<v Majernik, Peter>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/650-0
00:30:03.542 --> 00:30:07.824
<v Majernik, Peter>I I probably do,
I'm just not sure how to formulate them</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/650-1
00:30:07.824 --> 00:30:12.107
<v Majernik, Peter>at the moment.
So so when going back to this AI assisted</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/646-0
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:10.302
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/650-2
00:30:12.107 --> 00:30:16.465
<v Majernik, Peter>output instructions empty file.
So I look at the preview.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/650-3
00:30:16.465 --> 00:30:22.101
<v Majernik, Peter>Now it looks like human readable text,
but somewhere down there there is a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/650-4
00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:22.702
<v Majernik, Peter>section.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/656-0
00:30:23.062 --> 00:30:30.087
<v Majernik, Peter>About the standard metadata front matter
and that one looks like looks like YAML</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/651-0
00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:27.262
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/656-1
00:30:30.087 --> 00:30:35.117
<v Majernik, Peter>to me in a markdown.
Does that have any meaning that gets</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/653-0
00:30:33.662 --> 00:30:34.222
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/656-2
00:30:35.117 --> 00:30:40.582
<v Majernik, Peter>interpreted in a specific way or is that
still just free text?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/657-0
00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:41.942
<v John Miller>So let's look at the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/663-0
00:30:42.662 --> 00:30:47.938
<v Majernik, Peter>Like the copilot auto-generated front
matter required for formats that support</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/658-0
00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:44.382
<v John Miller>Mm.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/663-1
00:30:47.938 --> 00:30:52.346
<v Majernik, Peter>embedded YAML. So what is the?
What is the interpretation of that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/663-2
00:30:52.346 --> 00:30:57.022
<v Majernik, Peter>section from an AI perspective?
That's what I'm trying to comprehend.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/664-0
00:30:57.742 --> 00:30:59.182
<v John Miller>Um, that's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/668-0
00:31:00.422 --> 00:31:06.639
<v Majernik, Peter>Like if you Scroll down a little bit,
there is a it's called standard metadata</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/666-0
00:31:01.022 --> 00:31:02.102
<v John Miller>Take a look at this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/668-1
00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:07.662
<v Majernik, Peter>front matter.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/674-0
00:31:09.622 --> 00:31:13.416
<v Majernik, Peter>There, stop there. OK,
so when AI gets this instruction file,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/670-0
00:31:11.022 --> 00:31:11.182
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/674-1
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:18.251
<v Majernik, Peter>it's trying to understand what it's
supposed to do. What does it do with this?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/674-2
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:21.862
<v Majernik, Peter>Like how? How is that interpreted?
Is there meaning to it?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/672-0
00:31:19.142 --> 00:31:19.302
<v John Miller>But.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/678-0
00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:26.222
<v John Miller>It's it's really well it there's meaning
to it in the sense that it's data that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/678-1
00:31:26.222 --> 00:31:32.270
<v John Miller>you can retrieve from reference inside of
their your instructions or inside of your</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/678-2
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.798
<v John Miller>prompts.
So but it's not something that actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/678-3
00:31:35.798 --> 00:31:38.822
<v John Miller>causes anything to happen everything that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/682-0
00:31:38.902 --> 00:31:45.027
<v John Miller>Everything that happens it actually is in
the actual instructions itself and what</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/682-1
00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:51.302
<v John Miller>this is this AI assisted software develop
the preview output instructions is trying</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/682-2
00:31:51.302 --> 00:31:55.262
<v John Miller>to do is to tell the AI when you generate
an output.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/687-0
00:31:55.782 --> 00:32:00.823
<v John Miller>I want to have this information included
in that, but it's just metadata.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/687-1
00:32:00.823 --> 00:32:05.661
<v John Miller>It's not actually something that is,
you know, directly interpretable.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/687-2
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:10.838
<v John Miller>It doesn't cause anything to actually be
created, but it can be referenced.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/687-3
00:32:10.838 --> 00:32:12.542
<v John Miller>You can you can say in a.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/690-0
00:32:12.822 --> 00:32:17.716
<v John Miller>In an instruction,
do something or include the chat ID in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/690-1
00:32:17.716 --> 00:32:24.382
<v John Miller>some processing in the in the file itself,
but what we're really trying to do.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/694-0
00:32:22.502 --> 00:32:25.473
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so so a so AI does understand the chat ID</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/694-1
00:32:25.473 --> 00:32:29.155
<v Majernik, Peter>through the AI.
It's not just the string that's the chat</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/692-0
00:32:28.222 --> 00:32:29.862
<v John Miller>Yes, it it it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/694-2
00:32:29.155 --> 00:32:32.062
<v Majernik, Peter>ID, it's the actual ID of the chat,
correct?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/698-0
00:32:32.422 --> 00:32:37.542
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's correct.
So you you it's it's it's additional data</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/695-0
00:32:34.382 --> 00:32:34.502
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/698-1
00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:43.782
<v John Miller>that gets essentially put into the file
that can be can be actionable because</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/698-2
00:32:43.782 --> 00:32:45.942
<v John Miller>it's a part of the context.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/700-0
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:51.502
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, so it's almost like a variable. OK,
thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/704-0
00:32:50.742 --> 00:32:54.123
<v John Miller>Yes, it's almost like a almost.
It's almost like a variable.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/704-1
00:32:54.123 --> 00:32:57.561
<v John Miller>And I I was gonna look for the, well,
the example of it here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/704-2
00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.222
<v John Miller>You can see that these are placeholders,
right?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/703-0
00:33:00.822 --> 00:33:01.102
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/709-0
00:33:01.982 --> 00:33:06.877
<v John Miller>So what happens is that when it generates
the standard metadata front matter,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/705-0
00:33:02.662 --> 00:33:03.102
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/709-1
00:33:06.877 --> 00:33:11.458
<v John Miller>when in a course of generate a file,
we tell it to create AC sharp file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/709-2
00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:16.542
<v John Miller>It's going to put all of this in the top
of the file, but it will replace these.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/713-0
00:33:16.822 --> 00:33:21.416
<v John Miller>Placeholders with the actual provider,
or in this case,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/713-1
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:28.062
<v John Miller>what is the username of the actual person
that actually ran or created the file?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/711-0
00:33:22.782 --> 00:33:24.382
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/717-0
00:33:28.462 --> 00:33:32.091
<v Majernik, Peter>So now my next question would be
something like OK,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/717-1
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:37.117
<v Majernik, Peter>if there is a tag or variable or
something to replace with the real IDs</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/717-2
00:33:37.117 --> 00:33:41.724
<v Majernik, Peter>called copilot chat ID,
where can I get the complete list of such</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/717-3
00:33:41.724 --> 00:33:42.702
<v Majernik, Peter>IDs or tokens?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/718-0
00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:45.182
<v Majernik, Peter>Is there a complete list of them?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/721-0
00:33:45.862 --> 00:33:52.942
<v John Miller>Well, let's see. I mean, we're still here.
We can ask it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/724-0
00:34:03.422 --> 00:34:05.342
<v Majernik, Peter>I bet there is a complete list somewhere.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/727-0
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:09.123
<v John Miller>Well, I don't think it's.
There's no thing,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/727-1
00:34:09.123 --> 00:34:13.650
<v John Miller>there's no file that contains it,
but it should be able to look at the code</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/727-2
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.782
<v John Miller>base and find them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/732-0
00:34:27.382 --> 00:34:31.062
<v John Miller>Other questions while we're while we're
waiting.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/731-0
00:34:30.422 --> 00:34:31.102
<v Majernik, Peter>The.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/734-0
00:34:33.102 --> 00:34:34.662
<v John Miller>Notice that it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/736-0
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:39.782
<v John Miller>So it's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/741-0
00:34:39.342 --> 00:34:43.153
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, John, I I actually,
I didn't mean to list the chat IDs.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/741-1
00:34:43.153 --> 00:34:47.886
<v Majernik, Peter>What I was curious about is if there is
something that's called chat ID that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/741-2
00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:51.944
<v Majernik, Peter>sounds like a variable,
how do I get a complete list of variables</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/741-3
00:34:51.944 --> 00:34:56.862
<v Majernik, Peter>that Copilot understands that I can embed
embed in these instructions MD files?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/745-0
00:34:58.222 --> 00:35:02.302
<v John Miller>Well, the if we looked at.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/742-0
00:34:59.182 --> 00:34:59.422
<v Majernik, Peter>Is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/743-0
00:35:01.822 --> 00:35:02.062
<v Majernik, Peter>On.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/746-0
00:35:05.982 --> 00:35:06.062
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/749-0
00:35:07.382 --> 00:35:10.866
<v Majernik, Peter>And and if this is like distracting,
hijacking the conversation,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/749-1
00:35:10.866 --> 00:35:14.297
<v Majernik, Peter>please stop me. I I'm just,
I have a hard time wrapping my head</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/749-2
00:35:14.297 --> 00:35:15.262
<v Majernik, Peter>around that piece.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/752-0
00:35:14.422 --> 00:35:19.093
<v John Miller>Well,
if you're if you're having difficulty,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/752-1
00:35:19.093 --> 00:35:23.142
<v John Miller>then we should take a look at it. It's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/754-0
00:35:24.582 --> 00:35:29.222
<v John Miller>Seems weird, but I can't find it.
I'm gonna.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/756-0
00:35:27.382 --> 00:35:31.187
<v Majernik, Peter>In in other words,
like you know you typed in chat under</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/756-1
00:35:31.187 --> 00:35:36.261
<v Majernik, Peter>score ID, why is it not chat dash ID?
Like how did you know it was an under</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/756-2
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:36.862
<v Majernik, Peter>score ID?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/761-0
00:35:37.102 --> 00:35:40.291
<v John Miller>Oh yeah,
so that was kind of what I was trying to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/758-0
00:35:40.222 --> 00:35:40.342
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/761-1
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:45.203
<v John Miller>show. So if we were to look at this,
so is it use chat ID is embedded in the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/761-2
00:35:45.203 --> 00:35:48.010
<v John Miller>front matter, right?
So it's a just a term.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/761-3
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.902
<v John Miller>Here we see the copilot chat ID is what
it's using for that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/762-0
00:35:52.422 --> 00:35:53.902
<v John Miller>So who?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/765-0
00:35:52.742 --> 00:35:55.314
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so where is the complete list of those</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/765-1
00:35:55.314 --> 00:35:58.246
<v Majernik, Peter>IDs in those brackets?
The copilot dash chat ID?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/765-2
00:35:58.246 --> 00:35:59.742
<v Majernik, Peter>Where did that come from?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/766-0
00:35:59.702 --> 00:36:02.422
<v John Miller>That's what I'm headed towards.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/767-0
00:36:00.902 --> 00:36:03.982
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that predefined in Copilot?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/769-0
00:36:04.542 --> 00:36:07.622
<v John Miller>No, it's not. It's um,
maybe it's in the other file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/771-0
00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:14.022
<v John Miller>Where is it?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/772-0
00:36:15.862 --> 00:36:16.302
<v Majernik, Peter>S.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/774-0
00:36:16.382 --> 00:36:16.462
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/778-0
00:36:29.342 --> 00:36:33.182
<v John Miller>So each chat gets a a new chat ID.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/786-0
00:36:40.422 --> 00:36:44.540
<v Carter, Jake>I don't think this chat ID is like
metadata that comes with the like the the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/786-1
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.374
<v Carter, Jake>chat, right?
This is something that the LLM produces</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/786-2
00:36:47.374 --> 00:36:50.316
<v Carter, Jake>based on these instructions.
So you could like create.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/786-3
00:36:50.316 --> 00:36:54.702
<v Carter, Jake>You could name it something else if you
wanted to, Peter, if that clears that up.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/784-0
00:36:51.462 --> 00:36:52.022
<v Majernik, Peter>That's correct.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/790-0
00:36:54.182 --> 00:36:58.907
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's what I was trying to get to.
I was looking for the place in the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/790-1
00:36:58.907 --> 00:37:03.817
<v John Miller>instruction files that actually says how
to how to actually craft a chat ID and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/790-2
00:37:03.817 --> 00:37:08.297
<v John Miller>it's it's based partly on the prompts
that you're you're running what it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/790-3
00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:11.182
<v John Miller>understands about your your your
instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/793-0
00:37:12.462 --> 00:37:16.483
<v John Miller>So it's it's not magic,
it's just part of the instructions is how</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/793-1
00:37:16.483 --> 00:37:20.382
<v John Miller>to create a chat ID,
and then once you've defined that chat ID,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/793-2
00:37:20.382 --> 00:37:25.073
<v John Miller>you can then use that chat ID to do
things like build a name of a file or or</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/793-3
00:37:25.073 --> 00:37:25.622
<v John Miller>the like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/795-0
00:37:26.902 --> 00:37:30.422
<v John Miller>But I I'm having difficulty right now.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/798-0
00:37:29.662 --> 00:37:33.392
<v Majernik, Peter>No, it's fine. I mean,
we don't need to get stuck on this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/798-1
00:37:33.392 --> 00:37:37.502
<v Majernik, Peter>I was just curious where those are and
what they look like, but.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-0
00:37:37.902 --> 00:37:40.483
<v John Miller>Yeah,
I mean as far as your your to go more</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/799-0
00:37:38.862 --> 00:37:38.902
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-1
00:37:40.483 --> 00:37:44.239
<v John Miller>closely to your question,
I'm not really aware of any variables</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-2
00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:48.170
<v John Miller>that are available to you,
but I haven't delved that deep into it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-3
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:51.221
<v John Miller>You know,
you might be able to do some research and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-4
00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:55.856
<v John Miller>find out there are you know what is
something along the lines of what is what,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/804-5
00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:57.382
<v John Miller>what values are available.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/810-0
00:37:57.422 --> 00:38:01.533
<v John Miller>To you when you're actually running a
prompt and it might there might be</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/810-1
00:38:01.533 --> 00:38:05.306
<v John Miller>something that you can actually take
advantage of. But in my work,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/810-2
00:38:05.306 --> 00:38:08.910
<v John Miller>what I've been doing,
all of this is just generated as a result</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/810-3
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.022
<v John Miller>of the instruction files that I've asked
the AI to create and of course.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/806-0
00:38:10.302 --> 00:38:10.582
<v Majernik, Peter>Yes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/808-0
00:38:12.182 --> 00:38:12.982
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, I see.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/814-0
00:38:13.342 --> 00:38:18.819
<v John Miller>Right. So I've basically said OK create a,
you know create a prompt that does this</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/814-1
00:38:18.819 --> 00:38:24.230
<v John Miller>and when and then it will because it has
instructions to create a chat ID and put</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/814-2
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.398
<v John Miller>that in the log,
that's it goes and follows the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/814-3
00:38:27.398 --> 00:38:28.982
<v John Miller>instructions to do that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/816-0
00:38:31.062 --> 00:38:31.942
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/817-0
00:38:31.702 --> 00:38:33.782
<v John Miller>So sure.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/819-0
00:38:36.102 --> 00:38:37.862
<v John Miller>Let's see where we are.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-0
00:38:42.062 --> 00:38:46.089
<v John Miller>So if you wanted to take advantage of
these things from that repo which we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-1
00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:48.291
<v John Miller>showed,
you can just copy them into your</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-2
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:52.640
<v John Miller>instructions folder and they will then
become a part of your context and you can</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-3
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.345
<v John Miller>then take advantage of them.
So if you want to start logging your AI</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-4
00:38:56.345 --> 00:38:59.030
<v John Miller>request,
you can just take the copilot and the AI</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/825-5
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.662
<v John Miller>one and put those in your instruction
files and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/828-0
00:39:01.662 --> 00:39:04.955
<v John Miller>Done all of a sudden,
but then start to be invoked.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/828-1
00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:10.022
<v John Miller>Same thing's true of just about any other
instruction file that's in that repo.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/833-0
00:39:11.422 --> 00:39:18.405
<v John Miller>So we talked about this one quite a bit.
It's that it is provenance for all the AI</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/833-1
00:39:18.405 --> 00:39:23.453
<v John Miller>assisted artifacts.
The thing about it is that this and the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/833-2
00:39:23.453 --> 00:39:30.269
<v John Miller>reason I created it is because I wanted
to standardize this in some way and then</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/833-3
00:39:30.269 --> 00:39:30.942
<v John Miller>I added.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/835-0
00:39:31.022 --> 00:39:36.699
<v John Miller>The features related to the the capturing
the the conversation and creating the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/835-1
00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:37.622
<v John Miller>summary file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/837-0
00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:44.782
<v John Miller>And the copilot instruction one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/839-0
00:39:46.422 --> 00:39:48.382
<v John Miller>Reading new chat logs.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/844-0
00:39:50.542 --> 00:39:54.470
<v John Miller>Generating a a prompt for Evergreen
software development.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/844-1
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:59.956
<v John Miller>So we could do something like create a
prompt file that generates an instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/844-2
00:39:59.956 --> 00:40:05.442
<v John Miller>file for Evergreen software development
and then we could add in C# or something</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/844-3
00:40:05.442 --> 00:40:07.542
<v John Miller>along those lines if we wanted.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/845-0
00:40:08.662 --> 00:40:12.262
<v John Miller>So if you go to our.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/847-0
00:40:13.662 --> 00:40:14.382
<v John Miller>Just roll.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/850-0
00:40:19.862 --> 00:40:23.782
<v John Miller>Oh, here one. Yeah, that was fine.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/851-0
00:40:25.542 --> 00:40:26.982
<v John Miller>So here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/854-0
00:40:29.582 --> 00:40:33.582
<v John Miller>I asked it to, so let me undo these.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/855-0
00:40:35.662 --> 00:40:37.742
<v John Miller>And we'll kind of go through this in
there.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/861-0
00:40:39.942 --> 00:40:43.932
<v John Miller>No, this is we had it.
We asked it to do this. All right,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/861-1
00:40:43.932 --> 00:40:49.022
<v John Miller>let me let me explain what this was.
So remember we we we ran a prompt to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/861-2
00:40:49.022 --> 00:40:53.219
<v John Miller>create instruction files for the
technology in this project.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/861-3
00:40:53.219 --> 00:40:57.622
<v John Miller>Now just an interesting aside of this is
that you can then say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/863-0
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:04.062
<v John Miller>Create a prompt that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/864-0
00:41:07.542 --> 00:41:07.782
<v John Miller>Creates.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/870-0
00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:14.388
<v John Miller>An instruction file for the technology in
a project,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/870-1
00:41:14.388 --> 00:41:19.163
<v John Miller>and now we've created essentially a
prompt that creates an instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/870-2
00:41:19.163 --> 00:41:24.062
<v John Miller>And the reason that you might want to do
this is that you've got more than one</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/870-3
00:41:24.062 --> 00:41:28.961
<v John Miller>project that you want to apply this to
that has different technology in it and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/870-4
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:30.822
<v John Miller>you saw that this prompt file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/875-0
00:41:31.102 --> 00:41:36.154
<v John Miller>You could then apply to multiple
different projects and it will produce a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/875-1
00:41:36.154 --> 00:41:39.568
<v John Miller>unique set of instruction files for that
project.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/875-2
00:41:39.568 --> 00:41:45.030
<v John Miller>And by creating a prompt file for it,
it allows you to easily share that prompt</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/875-3
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:49.742
<v John Miller>among multiple different projects by
committing it into a different.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/880-0
00:41:49.902 --> 00:41:56.630
<v John Miller>A repository that can be accessed from
these different projects or some other</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/880-1
00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:03.013
<v John Miller>way of sharing instruction files.
So this is what I did to create some of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/880-2
00:42:03.013 --> 00:42:09.742
<v John Miller>the prompts that I'm showing you here was
to say OK, start off with a simple.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/885-0
00:42:09.822 --> 00:42:15.107
<v John Miller>Like that and then turn it into a prompt
file that makes it conform to all the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/885-1
00:42:15.107 --> 00:42:20.593
<v John Miller>standards that I've already set forth for
how a prompt file should be structured.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/885-2
00:42:20.593 --> 00:42:25.811
<v John Miller>That way I get consistent prompt files
that have a format that's expected and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/885-3
00:42:25.811 --> 00:42:28.822
<v John Miller>not just prompt files that contain a
single.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/888-0
00:42:28.862 --> 00:42:36.294
<v John Miller>A single sentence in them.
So we went through this exercise and we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/888-1
00:42:36.294 --> 00:42:42.062
<v John Miller>created all of these instruction files.
So we have.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/891-0
00:42:43.742 --> 00:42:53.062
<v John Miller>This the WPF one here which is
referencing a WPF document.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/894-0
00:42:55.902 --> 00:43:01.931
<v John Miller>And one I think is useful is that we go
ahead and let's keep all of these</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/894-1
00:43:01.931 --> 00:43:04.702
<v John Miller>instruction files we can then say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/896-0
00:43:07.342 --> 00:43:08.662
<v John Miller>Compare.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/898-0
00:43:12.182 --> 00:43:13.822
<v John Miller>The code base.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/901-0
00:43:19.622 --> 00:43:22.342
<v John Miller>With the instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/902-0
00:43:26.422 --> 00:43:26.582
<v John Miller>In.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/905-0
00:43:31.502 --> 00:43:34.302
<v John Miller>Here we can say uh file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/911-0
00:43:50.742 --> 00:43:52.022
<v John Miller>Well, maybe.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/918-0
00:44:04.302 --> 00:44:06.766
<v John Miller>What I was looking for is files or
formers,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/918-1
00:44:06.766 --> 00:44:09.062
<v John Miller>but we can just say in instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/920-0
00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:12.342
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/922-0
00:44:19.262 --> 00:44:20.622
<v Majernik, Peter>Can you ask a question while you're
typing?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/923-0
00:44:22.182 --> 00:44:22.342
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/928-0
00:44:22.982 --> 00:44:29.564
<v Majernik, Peter>So let's say you generate the WPF
instruction files and then you say OK,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/928-1
00:44:29.564 --> 00:44:36.868
<v Majernik, Peter>use the instruction file to generate AC
sharp class for this WPF object and then</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/928-2
00:44:36.868 --> 00:44:38.942
<v Majernik, Peter>you contrast that with.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/932-0
00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:41.984
<v Majernik, Peter>Doing the same without an instruction
file?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/932-1
00:44:41.984 --> 00:44:46.372
<v Majernik, Peter>Like what is the benefit of having an
instruction file that you haven't</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/932-2
00:44:46.372 --> 00:44:48.262
<v Majernik, Peter>actually customized like is is?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/930-0
00:44:46.942 --> 00:44:47.542
<v John Miller>Yeah, John.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/933-0
00:44:49.342 --> 00:44:51.422
<v Majernik, Peter>Did did that make any sense?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/935-0
00:44:50.702 --> 00:44:53.062
<v John Miller>Yeah, it does. Um, well.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/938-0
00:44:53.502 --> 00:44:58.568
<v Majernik, Peter>So is it like processing power?
Like is it faster to go one way or the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/938-1
00:44:58.568 --> 00:45:02.422
<v Majernik, Peter>other way?
Is it like better in any way quality wise?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/942-0
00:45:02.462 --> 00:45:06.501
<v John Miller>Well,
we we have you know some C# code in our</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/942-1
00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:13.087
<v John Miller>file already and some WPF files.
So what I've asked it to do is to compare</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/942-2
00:45:13.087 --> 00:45:17.742
<v John Miller>what we created yesterday without
instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/946-0
00:45:19.582 --> 00:45:24.509
<v John Miller>With the instruction files that we've
just created today and it's going through</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/946-1
00:45:24.509 --> 00:45:29.068
<v John Miller>and reading all the instruction files.
You can see that here and now it's</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/946-2
00:45:29.068 --> 00:45:32.763
<v John Miller>reading all of the code.
It's in the project that conforms.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/946-3
00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:35.782
<v John Miller>You can see it's it's looking at the XAML
files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/951-0
00:45:36.062 --> 00:45:40.770
<v John Miller>The project files,
the C files and it's going to scan that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/951-1
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:46.995
<v John Miller>code base for that technology usage and
compare those instructions versus the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/951-2
00:45:46.995 --> 00:45:52.742
<v John Miller>code base and it will then put out a list
after it does the comparison.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/952-0
00:45:55.262 --> 00:45:57.822
<v John Miller>And give us a summary of what it actually
found.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/956-0
00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:02.487
<v Majernik, Peter>So so now imagine that you didn't have
the instruction file and you would say</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/956-1
00:46:02.487 --> 00:46:07.332
<v Majernik, Peter>something like analyze my project and
show me what's not perfect in my WPF code.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/956-2
00:46:07.332 --> 00:46:10.742
<v Majernik, Peter>Would it give you the same answer or a
different answer?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/962-0
00:46:11.022 --> 00:46:14.055
<v John Miller>Well,
we kind of did that at the end of the day</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/962-1
00:46:14.055 --> 00:46:18.604
<v John Miller>yesterday when we said is this code
Evergreen? And it produced a whole,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/962-2
00:46:18.604 --> 00:46:23.343
<v John Miller>a whole list of things. You know,
it's a very simple prompt that we added.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/959-0
00:46:19.022 --> 00:46:20.702
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, OK, got it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/962-3
00:46:23.343 --> 00:46:27.451
<v John Miller>You could turn, you know,
this prompt into a prompt file because</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/962-4
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.462
<v John Miller>you would might.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/963-0
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:32.782
<v John Miller>You might want to fine tune the
instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/966-0
00:46:33.702 --> 00:46:38.186
<v John Miller>Because, you know, right now we're doing,
we're doing these instruction files and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/966-1
00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:42.342
<v John Miller>we're assuming that they're correct,
which may or may not be the case, but.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/972-0
00:46:43.022 --> 00:46:46.177
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah,
I'm just trying to figure out if it makes</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/967-0
00:46:43.502 --> 00:46:43.742
<v John Miller>1.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/972-1
00:46:46.177 --> 00:46:50.845
<v Majernik, Peter>any sense to have an instruction file
that I do not customize. I mean,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/972-2
00:46:50.845 --> 00:46:55.382
<v Majernik, Peter>you would create it to customize,
try to make it work for your team.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/970-0
00:46:54.662 --> 00:46:55.182
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/975-0
00:46:56.222 --> 00:46:59.789
<v John Miller>Right, right. So you would look at,
for example, WPF and say,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/975-1
00:46:59.789 --> 00:47:03.011
<v John Miller>does this instruction file conform to our
expectations?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/975-2
00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:07.153
<v John Miller>Because what it's using for the
determination was that link that it had</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/975-3
00:47:07.153 --> 00:47:08.822
<v John Miller>done at the bottom, which is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/980-0
00:47:09.982 --> 00:47:15.011
<v John Miller>Coming from Microsoft Learn,
if your if your standards don't coincide</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/980-1
00:47:15.011 --> 00:47:20.184
<v John Miller>well or they're different different from
what this is recommended here,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/980-2
00:47:20.184 --> 00:47:25.142
<v John Miller>then you would definitely want to update
this instruction file with.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/984-0
00:47:25.662 --> 00:47:28.715
<v John Miller>To match what your expectations are,
right?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/984-1
00:47:28.715 --> 00:47:32.047
<v John Miller>So in in the sense of a workflow for,
you know,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/984-2
00:47:32.047 --> 00:47:37.321
<v John Miller>using AI to help you write more new code
and make sure that it's compliant,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/984-3
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:42.735
<v John Miller>the first thing you would want to do is
to create these instruction files and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/984-4
00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:44.262
<v John Miller>review them as a team.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/988-0
00:47:44.702 --> 00:47:50.432
<v John Miller>And modify them as appropriate to
actually reflect what you have agreed on</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/988-1
00:47:50.432 --> 00:47:55.474
<v John Miller>as a team is what you expect.
And then once you've codified that,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/988-2
00:47:55.474 --> 00:47:59.982
<v John Miller>you can then apply them.
And here we see it's recommended.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/989-0
00:48:00.062 --> 00:48:00.222
<v John Miller>M.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/993-0
00:48:01.382 --> 00:48:07.213
<v John Miller>That C# rules member ordering and naming
are fine,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/993-1
00:48:07.213 --> 00:48:11.902
<v John Miller>but added a note about existing patterns.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/996-0
00:48:13.382 --> 00:48:21.462
<v John Miller>Recommendations for for WPF instructions,
alignment, small improvements.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/999-0
00:48:25.622 --> 00:48:29.822
<v John Miller>And you can do.
We did that prompt yesterday about.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1001-0
00:48:33.302 --> 00:48:33.462
<v John Miller>Mm.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1004-0
00:48:40.782 --> 00:48:43.502
<v John Miller>This is where I switching the CIDCD
pipeline.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1005-0
00:48:45.262 --> 00:48:45.822
<v John Miller>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1007-0
00:48:48.422 --> 00:48:50.102
<v John Miller>Yeah, so we say here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1009-0
00:48:52.182 --> 00:48:57.102
<v John Miller>And then say show me where the code is
not compliant.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1011-0
00:48:59.742 --> 00:49:01.742
<v John Miller>Tell me is the code.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1014-0
00:49:08.142 --> 00:49:12.822
<v John Miller>Evergreen and then it will just give you
a yes or a no.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1019-0
00:49:14.182 --> 00:49:19.817
<v John Miller>And this will be something that we could
use in a pipeline to run this prompts and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1019-1
00:49:19.817 --> 00:49:24.026
<v John Miller>if it if it says no,
upload the up upload a PR or update a PR</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1019-2
00:49:24.026 --> 00:49:26.742
<v John Miller>with the reasons why it's not Evergreen.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1024-0
00:49:33.862 --> 00:49:39.335
<v John Miller>So trying to get to your question,
is it useful to have these instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1024-1
00:49:39.335 --> 00:49:42.294
<v John Miller>files?
And I would say definitely in my</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1024-2
00:49:42.294 --> 00:49:48.137
<v John Miller>experience having them gives you better
output faster than not having them and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1024-3
00:49:48.137 --> 00:49:51.022
<v John Miller>and having the ability to say you know.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1029-0
00:49:51.622 --> 00:49:56.785
<v John Miller>You know, and just take this one file,
which not the not the instruction file,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1029-1
00:49:56.785 --> 00:50:00.380
<v John Miller>but maybe program dot CS and say is this
a clean code?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1029-2
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.543
<v John Miller>It will be able to evaluate that code
against whatever you've defined as clean</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1029-3
00:50:05.543 --> 00:50:08.942
<v John Miller>code and then tell you yes or no it is or
it isn't.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1030-0
00:50:09.342 --> 00:50:11.582
<v John Miller>And if you leave off the instructions.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1032-0
00:50:15.342 --> 00:50:15.662
<v John Miller>It will.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1035-0
00:50:21.662 --> 00:50:26.262
<v John Miller>Completed short verdict partial.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1038-0
00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.062
<v John Miller>So um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1042-0
00:50:34.502 --> 00:50:38.000
<v John Miller>So yeah, I think this is.
I definitely think this is worthwhile.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1042-1
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.413
<v John Miller>The other thing is that you know you can
because this becomes part of every every</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1042-2
00:50:42.413 --> 00:50:44.782
<v John Miller>prompt where it's applicable based on
your.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1044-0
00:50:46.382 --> 00:50:52.142
<v John Miller>Applies to because you can see that these
apply to different sets of files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1048-0
00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:57.304
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, about that,
is it defined in the file what it applies</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1048-1
00:50:57.304 --> 00:51:01.782
<v Majernik, Peter>to or do you do that in?
Do you do that in the prompt?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1046-0
00:50:58.262 --> 00:50:58.742
<v John Miller>Here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1053-0
00:51:01.382 --> 00:51:06.863
<v John Miller>It's in the instruction file.
Here is this applies to is essentially</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1053-1
00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:12.423
<v John Miller>says what what files does this
instruction file apply to and this one</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1050-0
00:51:09.462 --> 00:51:09.582
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1053-2
00:51:12.423 --> 00:51:18.222
<v John Miller>would be only files that are are
calculator in the calculator dot tests.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1056-0
00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:25.721
<v John Miller>And in any subfolders under that this
would WPF applies any calculator dash WPF</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1056-1
00:51:25.721 --> 00:51:28.862
<v John Miller>files. It's 'cause you can see that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1062-0
00:51:27.582 --> 00:51:30.741
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so it's basically it that looks like path</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1062-1
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Majernik, Peter>based,
is that correct assumption or are there</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1058-0
00:51:31.142 --> 00:51:35.022
<v John Miller>It is. It is. That's the correct.
That's correct. It's actually.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1062-2
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:39.328
<v Majernik, Peter>any other ways to specify those filters
like look through the whole structure</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1060-0
00:51:37.662 --> 00:51:37.862
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1062-3
00:51:39.328 --> 00:51:43.862
<v Majernik, Peter>recursively and only pick up star dot TXT
or something like that?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1067-0
00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:48.685
<v John Miller>Yes, yeah, yeah, that's certainly.
You can certainly do that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1067-1
00:51:48.685 --> 00:51:54.678
<v John Miller>You could say just look at all the update
all the read me files and specify that it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1067-2
00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:59.102
<v John Miller>only applies to files that end end in a
dot MD extension and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1066-0
00:51:57.982 --> 00:51:58.382
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1071-0
00:51:59.462 --> 00:52:04.624
<v John Miller>And and I might have a slide a little bit
later about you know some of the other</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1071-1
00:52:04.624 --> 00:52:09.086
<v John Miller>ways that you can you can actually
specify applies to. It's not just,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1071-2
00:52:09.086 --> 00:52:13.102
<v John Miller>it's not just path based,
but you can do other things as well.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1074-0
00:52:12.342 --> 00:52:15.580
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, but fundamentally,
so every prompt looks at all the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1074-1
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Majernik, Peter>instruction files, right?
And then these within the instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1074-2
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.056
<v Majernik, Peter>file,
each of them determines what they applied</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1074-3
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.022
<v Majernik, Peter>themselves to something like that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1077-0
00:52:23.062 --> 00:52:31.102
<v John Miller>That's correct because we we saw that
when we when we ran this here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1075-0
00:52:25.262 --> 00:52:25.382
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1078-0
00:52:32.942 --> 00:52:34.622
<v John Miller>Well, I think we.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1080-0
00:52:35.582 --> 00:52:38.022
<v John Miller>We're back. We ran another process.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1083-0
00:52:35.942 --> 00:52:41.115
<v Majernik, Peter>I I just wanna make sure I don't have to
specify for each prompt which ones I want</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1083-1
00:52:41.115 --> 00:52:43.982
<v Majernik, Peter>at all. Sounds like it's all declarative,
OK?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1084-0
00:52:41.822 --> 00:52:45.662
<v John Miller>No, see, it's all. It's all declared.
That's correct.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1085-0
00:52:47.022 --> 00:52:48.142
<v Majernik, Peter>Sounds good.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1088-0
00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:55.897
<v John Miller>So we have that instruction.
We could have modified this instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1088-1
00:52:55.897 --> 00:52:56.542
<v John Miller>to say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1091-0
00:53:00.582 --> 00:53:05.382
<v John Miller>Show me this code Evergreen and create.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1092-0
00:53:07.342 --> 00:53:07.942
<v John Miller>Issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1094-0
00:53:09.582 --> 00:53:11.342
<v John Miller>For what you find.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1097-0
00:53:18.302 --> 00:53:20.902
<v John Miller>And so this prompt will.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1100-0
00:53:22.582 --> 00:53:26.543
<v John Miller>More than just report back to us,
but it'll actually go ahead and create</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1100-1
00:53:26.543 --> 00:53:30.831
<v John Miller>issues in the issue file that we could
put into our backlog that we could then</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1100-2
00:53:30.831 --> 00:53:33.382
<v John Miller>use to make sure that we address these
issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1102-0
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:39.662
<v John Miller>So here it understands that the issues
are going to go into the issue folder.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1105-0
00:53:40.022 --> 00:53:45.243
<v Majernik, Peter>When you talk about issues,
is that an equivalent of a work item in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1109-0
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:49.102
<v John Miller>Yes, yes, that's correct.
And if you find it,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1105-1
00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:48.622
<v Majernik, Peter>Azure DevOps like a bug or a task or a
PBO?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1109-1
00:53:49.102 --> 00:53:55.597
<v John Miller>if you go and do a search for an MCP tool
for Azure DevOps that supports the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1109-2
00:53:55.597 --> 00:54:01.502
<v John Miller>creation of work items instead of putting
them into a file like this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1110-0
00:54:02.022 --> 00:54:04.422
<v John Miller>It would put them directly in as work
items.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1114-0
00:54:04.262 --> 00:54:10.182
<v Majernik, Peter>Like actually connect to Azure DevOps and
programmatically create the bugs for us.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1112-0
00:54:06.422 --> 00:54:07.022
<v John Miller>Into.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1113-0
00:54:08.102 --> 00:54:08.142
<v John Miller>I.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1116-0
00:54:10.182 --> 00:54:10.942
<v John Miller>That's that's correct.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-0
00:54:12.982 --> 00:54:15.511
<v John Miller>Right.
Or you could do a two step process that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-1
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:19.763
<v John Miller>creates these issue files that you see
created here and then you could say OK,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-2
00:54:19.763 --> 00:54:23.369
<v John Miller>I want you to create Azure.
You could actually go and review them,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-3
00:54:23.369 --> 00:54:25.790
<v John Miller>delete the ones you don't want,
update them,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-4
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:30.203
<v John Miller>change them in any way that you want and
then you say go create create work items</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1121-5
00:54:30.203 --> 00:54:30.742
<v John Miller>for these.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1126-0
00:54:32.982 --> 00:54:35.719
<v John Miller>So see here H1 has a problem,
why it matters.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1126-1
00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:38.338
<v John Miller>And just just to kind of elaborate on
that,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1126-2
00:54:38.338 --> 00:54:43.278
<v John Miller>if you have a very specific template that
you want to follow for those work items,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1126-3
00:54:43.278 --> 00:54:48.099
<v John Miller>you can specify what that template is and
then it will use that template when it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1126-4
00:54:48.099 --> 00:54:52.622
<v John Miller>creates it so that it creates a a work
item in a way that you expect it to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1128-0
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:58.999
<v John Miller>So you can see this is really powerful
for building backlogs,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1128-1
00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:01.062
<v John Miller>identifying the code, finding issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1132-0
00:55:03.342 --> 00:55:07.917
<v John Miller>And so it's done with that.
So we've got how many issues created 6/6</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1130-0
00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:05.902
<v Majernik, Peter>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1132-1
00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:08.382
<v John Miller>issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1133-0
00:55:11.262 --> 00:55:12.022
<v John Miller>Let's keep those.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1135-0
00:55:14.302 --> 00:55:18.262
<v John Miller>One that I found to be kind of
interesting was say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1137-0
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:21.822
<v John Miller>Review the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1139-0
00:55:25.982 --> 00:55:26.382
<v John Miller>Obese.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1141-0
00:55:30.782 --> 00:55:32.222
<v John Miller>For bugs.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1143-0
00:55:34.142 --> 00:55:37.222
<v John Miller>And create issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1146-0
00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:41.622
<v John Miller>Or your findings.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1148-0
00:55:43.062 --> 00:55:47.582
<v Majernik, Peter>What is? What is considered the bug here?
What's the?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1150-0
00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:49.262
<v John Miller>Oh, well, we're kind of um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1153-0
00:55:50.102 --> 00:55:53.151
<v Majernik, Peter>What is?
What is the definition that it's gonna</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1153-1
00:55:53.151 --> 00:55:55.502
<v Majernik, Peter>use to determine that there is a bug?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1156-0
00:55:55.382 --> 00:56:00.805
<v John Miller>All right, well,
let's save that then and say what do you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1156-1
00:56:00.805 --> 00:56:02.302
<v John Miller>can set our bug?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1164-0
00:56:22.062 --> 00:56:27.099
<v Majernik, Peter>So this question you just asked,
is that in the context of the project</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1164-1
00:56:27.099 --> 00:56:28.022
<v Majernik, Peter>that is open?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1163-0
00:56:27.902 --> 00:56:27.982
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1166-0
00:56:29.542 --> 00:56:33.822
<v John Miller>Well, it's scanning the code. Let's see,
it's explaining this account.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1178-0
00:56:48.502 --> 00:56:54.541
<v John Miller>So it's looks like it's looking at these
issues as as being as bugs.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1178-1
00:56:54.541 --> 00:57:01.368
<v John Miller>We could have these are in scope because
these files are open and things that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1178-2
00:57:01.368 --> 00:57:07.144
<v John Miller>we've worked on recently.
It talks talks about how it prioritizes</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1178-3
00:57:07.144 --> 00:57:07.582
<v John Miller>them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1179-0
00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:10.782
<v John Miller>And how it categorizes them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1183-0
00:57:14.422 --> 00:57:19.516
<v John Miller>And in terms of a definition,
any behaviour in code or configuration</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1183-1
00:57:19.516 --> 00:57:24.684
<v John Miller>that causes the software to behave
incorrectly rather relative to its</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1183-2
00:57:24.684 --> 00:57:26.382
<v John Miller>intended specification.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1186-0
00:57:27.862 --> 00:57:32.865
<v John Miller>So if we go back to the second prompt to
then review the code base and we can see</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1186-1
00:57:32.865 --> 00:57:35.062
<v John Miller>if it finds any defects in our code.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1188-0
00:57:39.942 --> 00:57:45.622
<v John Miller>So other questions or maybe we should
switch this?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1191-0
00:57:44.102 --> 00:57:50.836
<v Majernik, Peter>My wheels are turning like what is the
definition of intention here?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1191-1
00:57:50.836 --> 00:57:53.862
<v Majernik, Peter>How does AI know the intention?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1193-0
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:58.142
<v Majernik, Peter>I mean, I I get the concept.
I'm just like, I don't know.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1195-0
00:58:00.022 --> 00:58:03.102
<v Carter, Jake>I have a question, so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1196-0
00:58:00.542 --> 00:58:03.102
<v John Miller>What? Sure.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1202-0
00:58:05.222 --> 00:58:10.135
<v Carter, Jake>So say like you have like a sort of a big
project or big repository and you have</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1202-1
00:58:10.135 --> 00:58:13.229
<v Carter, Jake>lots and lots of instructions.
Will these take up?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1202-2
00:58:13.229 --> 00:58:17.839
<v Carter, Jake>Is it like possible like have so many
instructions that you start taking up</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1202-3
00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:19.902
<v Carter, Jake>like too much of the token budget?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1207-0
00:58:21.702 --> 00:58:24.507
<v Carter, Jake>Or is it like?
Because like say you have this C#</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1203-0
00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:22.862
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1207-1
00:58:24.507 --> 00:58:29.144
<v Carter, Jake>instruction and then say your code also
has like C code and like all these other</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1207-2
00:58:29.144 --> 00:58:31.835
<v Carter, Jake>languages.
If you're trying to work on C code,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1207-3
00:58:31.835 --> 00:58:35.442
<v Carter, Jake>like the C# code instructions probably
aren't really relevant.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1207-4
00:58:35.442 --> 00:58:39.622
<v Carter, Jake>Then does it start to hurt you by having
too many specific instructions?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1213-0
00:58:40.502 --> 00:58:44.231
<v John Miller>Well,
if your instructions have applies to and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1213-1
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:50.421
<v John Miller>your prompt is saying review all the C#
code you know for for this particular</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1213-2
00:58:50.421 --> 00:58:55.579
<v John Miller>issue that you want to,
then it's going to automatically exclude</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1213-3
00:58:55.579 --> 00:59:00.182
<v John Miller>the instruction files for the ones that
don't match that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1216-0
00:59:00.622 --> 00:59:04.662
<v John Miller>That request,
so it's going to know that AC file has a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1216-1
00:59:04.662 --> 00:59:09.071
<v John Miller>dot CS extension.
It will then only look at the instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1216-2
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:15.022
<v John Miller>files that apply to that and it will only
apply it to those files that it finds.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1221-0
00:59:15.502 --> 00:59:20.548
<v John Miller>So you you have some way of some fairly
simple way of controlling that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1221-1
00:59:20.548 --> 00:59:25.804
<v John Miller>So if you have a huge number of C# files,
you might run into a risk there,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1221-2
00:59:25.804 --> 00:59:31.622
<v John Miller>and in that case you could partition it
by just, you know, going folder by folder.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1224-0
00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:36.908
<v John Miller>And saying OK these you know in this
particular project I want you to evaluate</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1224-1
00:59:36.908 --> 00:59:40.915
<v John Miller>all of the C shar files and you should be
able to whittle it down so you don't</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1224-2
00:59:40.915 --> 00:59:43.502
<v John Miller>you're not seeing issues with your
context window.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1228-0
00:59:44.662 --> 00:59:47.431
<v Carter, Jake>OK,
so I this is maybe more of just like a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1228-1
00:59:47.431 --> 00:59:50.522
<v Carter, Jake>question of how these how like the agent
works.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1228-2
00:59:50.522 --> 00:59:55.868
<v Carter, Jake>Like whenever you say you like ask it to
do some sort of question and then it does</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1228-3
00:59:55.868 --> 01:00:00.891
<v Carter, Jake>like a bunch of different things like so
while it's doing all these different</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1228-4
01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:01.342
<v Carter, Jake>things.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1231-0
01:00:01.582 --> 01:00:07.510
<v Carter, Jake>Will it like tokenize and then like sort
of de tokenize different files or is it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1231-1
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:11.462
<v Carter, Jake>like 1 context per like I don't know
session I guess?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1236-0
01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:16.662
<v John Miller>Well,
it it's a the the context that applies to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1232-0
01:00:14.102 --> 01:00:14.622
<v Carter, Jake>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1236-1
01:00:16.662 --> 01:00:22.951
<v John Miller>the the currently executing prompt.
So that prompt will then load all of the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1236-2
01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:29.322
<v John Miller>context that it understands it needs to
load in order for you to execute that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1236-3
01:00:29.322 --> 01:00:30.302
<v John Miller>instruction.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1241-0
01:00:30.582 --> 01:00:35.726
<v John Miller>That can come from the prompt on the that
you put directly into the chat window.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1241-1
01:00:35.726 --> 01:00:40.553
<v John Miller>It can come from a prompt file that
specifically specifies what the what it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1241-2
01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:43.792
<v John Miller>should be using in terms of the
instruction files,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1241-3
01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:48.492
<v John Miller>or it can be in a chat mode that
specifies specifically what instructions</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1241-4
01:00:48.492 --> 01:00:49.382
<v John Miller>it should use.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-0
01:00:49.782 --> 01:00:54.105
<v John Miller>Or you can just have it infer what
instruction files it uses based on the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-1
01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:56.968
<v John Miller>applies to.
But that's a that's evaluated at the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-2
01:00:56.968 --> 01:01:01.467
<v John Miller>beginning of the execution of every
prompt and that builds that context from</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-3
01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:04.154
<v John Miller>that.
And that context only gets cleared when</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-4
01:01:04.154 --> 01:01:08.594
<v John Miller>you actually specify that you want a new
new chat and then we'll start from</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1247-5
01:01:08.594 --> 01:01:09.062
<v John Miller>scratch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1248-0
01:01:09.902 --> 01:01:10.102
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1246-0
01:01:11.742 --> 01:01:12.062
<v Carter, Jake>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1252-0
01:01:20.902 --> 01:01:26.342
<v John Miller>All right, so we what did we ask it to do?
We asked it to look for bugs and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1254-0
01:01:28.622 --> 01:01:30.262
<v John Miller>Doesn't look like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1258-0
01:01:34.462 --> 01:01:38.075
<v John Miller>Yeah,
I think by that it just it it inferred</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1258-1
01:01:38.075 --> 01:01:44.418
<v John Miller>that we were only talking about this
files. That's what it seems to me. Oh no,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1258-2
01:01:44.418 --> 01:01:45.462
<v John Miller>it says here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1260-0
01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.747
<v John Miller>Results.
It run the test and it saw that they</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1260-1
01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:50.302
<v John Miller>passed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1264-0
01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.870
<v John Miller>No,
notable warnings were produced in the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1264-1
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:59.983
<v John Miller>builds and tests.
This is something I also like to specify</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1264-2
01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:05.422
<v John Miller>in in instruction files some places that
you should treat warnings as errors.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1266-0
01:02:06.902 --> 01:02:13.227
<v John Miller>Because I don't like my builds throwing
up a lot of text that I want that I have</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1266-1
01:02:13.227 --> 01:02:13.462
<v John Miller>to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1268-0
01:02:14.822 --> 01:02:16.742
<v John Miller>Rule out his issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1276-0
01:02:31.382 --> 01:02:34.982
<v John Miller>So let me let's clear the context
completely and let's go ahead and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1280-0
01:02:37.622 --> 01:02:41.842
<v John Miller>I'll run this again 'cause I haven't
actually run this against code bases and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1280-1
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:46.062
<v John Miller>found it found issues that in the code
that hadn't been found through a test.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1282-0
01:02:47.582 --> 01:02:52.938
<v John Miller>And then I've asked it to go and create a
test to show that those issues are are</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1282-1
01:02:52.938 --> 01:02:54.062
<v John Miller>failing the test.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1285-0
01:02:56.662 --> 01:03:04.822
<v John Miller>Let me change the the model.
I'm still in mini and I think.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1286-0
01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:06.142
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1288-0
01:03:07.702 --> 01:03:09.942
<v John Miller>Claude Sonic might do a better job.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1292-0
01:03:22.742 --> 01:03:25.478
<v John Miller>Yeah,
so I know it's actually looking at the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1292-1
01:03:25.478 --> 01:03:27.302
<v John Miller>files and not just the issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1295-0
01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:33.422
<v John Miller>It's found to 20 C# files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1297-0
01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:41.342
<v John Miller>Now it's looking to get to the XAML files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1305-0
01:03:55.782 --> 01:03:59.097
<v John Miller>And this is a pretty small code base,
so there's a chance that it probably</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1305-1
01:03:59.097 --> 01:03:59.982
<v John Miller>won't find anything.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1312-0
01:04:16.822 --> 01:04:18.982
<v John Miller>Yeah, so there we go. That's good.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1316-0
01:04:31.862 --> 01:04:36.342
<v John Miller>So it found four issues and it's gonna
create additional.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1321-0
01:04:39.022 --> 01:04:45.146
<v John Miller>Issue files and again if this was if we
had a tool that would attach to Azure</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1321-1
01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:51.742
<v John Miller>DevOps that would that would allow us to
create Azure DevOps issues for or or bugs.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1322-0
01:04:55.022 --> 01:04:57.022
<v John Miller>Questions on this while it's finishing up.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1325-0
01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:05.351
<v John Miller>Here you can see the difference in the
model where the the the smaller model</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1325-1
01:05:05.351 --> 01:05:06.022
<v John Miller>just did not.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1327-0
01:05:06.822 --> 01:05:12.052
<v John Miller>We would need more prompting to get it to
scan the whole code base and this one did</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1327-1
01:05:12.052 --> 01:05:12.862
<v John Miller>a better job.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1330-0
01:05:18.342 --> 01:05:21.222
<v John Miller>It's just something I do when.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1332-0
01:05:22.102 --> 01:05:24.542
<v John Miller>If the context seems to get bogged down.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1336-0
01:05:25.782 --> 01:05:31.248
<v John Miller>In one model is to switch and recreate
the context in another model and see if</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1336-1
01:05:31.248 --> 01:05:36.507
<v John Miller>it can come up with a different approach
that might might be more suitable.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1336-2
01:05:36.507 --> 01:05:40.382
<v John Miller>Tend to bounce back and forth between
cloud sonnet and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1337-0
01:05:40.422 --> 01:05:41.582
<v John Miller>GPT.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1341-0
01:05:49.382 --> 01:05:54.848
<v John Miller>I'd like to do some experimentation about
how opinionated them are.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1341-1
01:05:54.848 --> 01:05:57.822
<v John Miller>They are by taking a a prompt that's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1348-0
01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:05.485
<v John Miller>That's that's trying to give you an
opinion about different models for code</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1348-1
01:06:05.485 --> 01:06:09.004
<v John Miller>generation,
like the work we did yesterday was like</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1348-2
01:06:09.004 --> 01:06:14.417
<v John Miller>give me a recommendation on or an opinion
on what different models are good for</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1348-3
01:06:14.417 --> 01:06:19.899
<v John Miller>code generation and running that in the
different models and see if their output</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1348-4
01:06:19.899 --> 01:06:20.102
<v John Miller>is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1349-0
01:06:20.182 --> 01:06:23.942
<v John Miller>How much their op difference and and how
much they favor their own model.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1352-0
01:06:32.382 --> 01:06:32.862
<v John Miller>All right, so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1355-0
01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:40.462
<v John Miller>Here comes the new issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1358-0
01:06:43.742 --> 01:06:49.782
<v John Miller>So, so definitely, as I mentioned,
this can be a a backlog technical debt.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1359-0
01:06:51.062 --> 01:06:54.142
<v John Miller>Generating machine.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1362-0
01:06:56.102 --> 01:07:01.768
<v John Miller>Because it's because it can.
It definitely can find things that you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1362-1
01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.102
<v John Miller>that you might overlook and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1367-0
01:07:05.942 --> 01:07:10.677
<v John Miller>And put things on your backlog that you
should probably address.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1367-1
01:07:10.677 --> 01:07:16.579
<v John Miller>Notice that it's found some high priority
things so that you know things that we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1367-2
01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:22.262
<v John Miller>want to take a a stab at at fixing,
which might be a good exercise. Go ahead.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1371-0
01:07:20.182 --> 01:07:26.643
<v Majernik, Peter>So, so I have another question here.
So it sounds like it's finding issues</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1371-1
01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:33.708
<v Majernik, Peter>that for example sonar cube would find.
So when you compare copilot with any kind</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1371-2
01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.862
<v Majernik, Peter>of static analysis tools.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1375-0
01:07:36.902 --> 01:07:41.517
<v Majernik, Peter>What is your opinion?
Does Copilot replace all of them or do we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1375-1
01:07:41.517 --> 01:07:46.422
<v Majernik, Peter>still need static analysis on our code
base in addition to Copilot?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1378-0
01:07:44.502 --> 01:07:48.609
<v John Miller>I haven't.
I don't have really an opinion because I</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1378-1
01:07:48.609 --> 01:07:53.901
<v John Miller>haven't tried to compare the two,
but that would be a an I think a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1378-2
01:07:53.901 --> 01:08:00.142
<v John Miller>worthwhile experiment is to essentially
put them both in the pipeline and see.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1382-0
01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:04.709
<v John Miller>See which one does a better job at
finding things. That might be.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1382-1
01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:10.069
<v John Miller>You might even put two or three models in
that same pipeline to see if they find</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1382-2
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:13.642
<v John Miller>different bugs.
You might find it that for particular</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1382-3
01:08:13.642 --> 01:08:16.422
<v John Miller>versions of of models that one of them is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1386-0
01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:20.856
<v John Miller>Better at finding a certain kind of an
issue than others are,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1386-1
01:08:20.856 --> 01:08:26.145
<v John Miller>and you can even have it and have
instructions to focus on just those kinds</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1386-2
01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:31.712
<v John Miller>of issues. So, but I don't, you know,
I'd be interested in finding out how well</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1386-3
01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:33.382
<v John Miller>it does at that kind of.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1391-0
01:08:34.182 --> 01:08:38.999
<v John Miller>Static analysis.
But I do think that it has the potential</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1391-1
01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:45.394
<v John Miller>of doing as good a job or or even a
better job because it's not just looking</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1391-2
01:08:45.394 --> 01:08:51.124
<v John Miller>at you know, Reg expression,
regex expressions or code or imperative</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1391-3
01:08:51.124 --> 01:08:53.782
<v John Miller>code based analysis. It's doing.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1395-0
01:08:54.022 --> 01:08:59.805
<v John Miller>More of a tokenized vector based analysis
of the code and I would expect that that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1395-1
01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:05.170
<v John Miller>in order to keep up the tools will have
to actually incorporate some AI into</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1395-2
01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:09.142
<v John Miller>their models in order for them to find
more deep rooted.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1396-0
01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:09.462
<v John Miller>Uh, defects.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1398-0
01:09:13.102 --> 01:09:15.422
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, we'll test that one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1401-0
01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:18.289
<v John Miller>But if you compare, yeah, you test,
you test it and after a couple of months</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1401-1
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:21.567
<v John Miller>you can make a decision and if Sonar is
not working out,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1401-2
01:09:21.567 --> 01:09:24.902
<v John Miller>you can consider changing how you
changing your pipeline.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1407-0
01:09:25.822 --> 01:09:29.932
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Yeah,
I think it's a it's a viable pro project</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1402-0
01:09:25.902 --> 01:09:27.062
<v Majernik, Peter>All right. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1407-1
01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:36.666
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>actually if if we can eliminate one of
the tools and move towards one called</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1405-0
01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:36.782
<v John Miller>Alright.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1407-2
01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:41.302
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>consolidated workflow that that would be
actually a.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1411-0
01:09:41.382 --> 01:09:44.447
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Well, the project,
I'm not sure how it would score regarding</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1411-1
01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:46.659
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>according to our priorities,
but I I would,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1411-2
01:09:46.659 --> 01:09:49.222
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>I would add it to the backlog something
like that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1414-0
01:09:48.502 --> 01:09:52.620
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's, I think that's a good idea.
I think it can,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1414-1
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:57.945
<v John Miller>it can apply to like security analysis.
You can say like look for security</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1414-2
01:09:57.945 --> 01:10:03.342
<v John Miller>defects in the code base and it can do a
static analysis of the code there.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1417-0
01:10:03.862 --> 01:10:09.913
<v John Miller>So there's a a number of different ways
that you can approach this in terms of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1417-1
01:10:09.913 --> 01:10:11.982
<v John Miller>that kind of bug detection.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1421-0
01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:18.748
<v John Miller>All right,
so we've got a bunch of issues here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1421-1
01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:22.756
<v John Miller>Why don't we try to fix one of them?
We have this one here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1421-2
01:10:22.756 --> 01:10:28.034
<v John Miller>We look at the bugs that were found,
a recursive evaluate call causing history</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1421-3
01:10:28.034 --> 01:10:28.702
<v John Miller>pollution.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1426-0
01:10:31.022 --> 01:10:37.431
<v John Miller>Oh, I was Speaking of recursion.
I can I've I've actually experienced</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1426-1
01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:44.663
<v John Miller>recursion in my AI prompts where I had a
a prompt whose purpose was is to make</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1426-2
01:10:44.663 --> 01:10:47.502
<v John Miller>sure all the prompts conformed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1431-0
01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:56.076
<v John Miller>To a prompt instruction file and if they
didn't to update the prompt and it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1431-1
01:10:56.076 --> 01:11:04.334
<v John Miller>applied that logic to the prompt that was
initiating the the actual investigation</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1431-2
01:11:04.334 --> 01:11:08.262
<v John Miller>of the prompt files and it modified it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1435-0
01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:13.227
<v John Miller>Itself and it got itself into a situation
where it was constantly trying to do the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1435-1
01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:17.937
<v John Miller>same update to the same file over and
over again and it was just looping in the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1435-2
01:11:17.937 --> 01:11:22.116
<v John Miller>chat window giving the same output over
and over cuz I hadn't kept the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1435-3
01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:24.942
<v John Miller>modifications that had been that were
approved.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1436-0
01:11:25.302 --> 01:11:27.622
<v John Miller>It was kind of interesting to see that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1437-0
01:11:27.942 --> 01:11:28.302
<v Majernik, Peter>Hmm.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1439-0
01:11:31.342 --> 01:11:34.142
<v John Miller>So all right, so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1443-0
01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:38.951
<v John Miller>A potential impact.
This is a medium priority one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1443-1
01:11:38.951 --> 01:11:43.162
<v John Miller>That's a low priority one.
Thread safety might be a little bit</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1443-2
01:11:43.162 --> 01:11:45.502
<v John Miller>tricky, so maybe this one issue #7.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1447-0
01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:55.168
<v John Miller>But what I wanna do is I wanna actually
implement it in two different AI models</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1447-1
01:11:55.168 --> 01:12:00.742
<v John Miller>and then compare and contrast them.
So what we wanna do is we're on this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1449-0
01:12:02.262 --> 01:12:07.308
<v John Miller>CICD fix branch.
Let's let's see if we can get merge back</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1449-1
01:12:07.308 --> 01:12:09.222
<v John Miller>to main. So how about?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1451-0
01:12:11.342 --> 01:12:12.862
<v John Miller>Commit to our.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1453-0
01:12:13.942 --> 01:12:16.782
<v John Miller>I had the changes, yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1455-0
01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:20.862
<v John Miller>Manage with me.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1464-0
01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:43.582
<v John Miller>So it wants us to do an ad.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1468-0
01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:54.182
<v John Miller>Here's our commit message.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1471-0
01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:05.222
<v John Miller>No,
it's our branches up to switch to main.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1473-0
01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:07.742
<v John Miller>Do a git purge.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1479-0
01:13:12.182 --> 01:13:16.082
<v Majernik, Peter>So, so John,
what you are doing here is you're</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1475-0
01:13:12.902 --> 01:13:13.942
<v John Miller>And a push.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1479-1
01:13:16.082 --> 01:13:21.145
<v Majernik, Peter>committing a lot of changes that are
technically not tested.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1479-2
01:13:21.145 --> 01:13:27.452
<v Majernik, Peter>So if we wanted to make sure that the
developer doesn't break any unit test</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1479-3
01:13:27.452 --> 01:13:29.942
<v Majernik, Peter>with their prompt engineering.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1483-0
01:13:30.262 --> 01:13:35.052
<v Majernik, Peter>Would the instructions file would be the
right place to put this check in,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1483-1
01:13:35.052 --> 01:13:38.693
<v Majernik, Peter>say before you push run all the unit
tests or something?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1483-2
01:13:38.693 --> 01:13:42.142
<v Majernik, Peter>Or would that be somewhere else like a
pipe pipeline?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1486-0
01:13:40.662 --> 01:13:45.399
<v John Miller>I would I would put that in.
I would I would put that into your branch</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1486-1
01:13:45.399 --> 01:13:48.669
<v John Miller>rules.
You can specify which for example you can</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1486-2
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:53.473
<v John Miller>specify that you cannot push domain
without a PR in some in some source</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1486-3
01:13:53.473 --> 01:13:55.342
<v John Miller>control systems like GitHub.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1492-0
01:13:55.822 --> 01:14:00.420
<v John Miller>Allows you to do that and I I'm pretty
sure Azure DevOps is the same.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1488-0
01:13:58.942 --> 01:14:00.542
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1492-1
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.413
<v John Miller>So that way that forces you into a PR
situation where we would have to push</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1492-2
01:14:05.413 --> 01:14:10.668
<v John Miller>this into a PR and then we talked about
the implementing an AI code review that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1492-3
01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:13.822
<v John Miller>if it found anything it would not allow
you to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1493-0
01:14:14.782 --> 01:14:16.382
<v John Miller>Approve the PR so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1497-0
01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:18.449
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
what about any pre-commit checks that we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1497-1
01:14:18.449 --> 01:14:22.722
<v Majernik, Peter>would want to run?
Would that be a good place for an</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1495-0
01:14:22.142 --> 01:14:22.822
<v John Miller>Mm.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1497-2
01:14:22.722 --> 01:14:25.302
<v Majernik, Peter>instruction file or not so much?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1501-0
01:14:23.862 --> 01:14:30.571
<v John Miller>Right. Well, I I think, well, in a sense,
once you have the instruction files in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1501-1
01:14:30.571 --> 01:14:36.038
<v John Miller>place, it's not going to,
it's not going to produce anything that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1501-2
01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:41.422
<v John Miller>that violates those instruction files
unless you have a context.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1503-0
01:14:41.622 --> 01:14:45.048
<v John Miller>Issue where the instruction file got
pushed out of memory.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1503-1
01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:49.462
<v John Miller>So the code that you create will be
compliant with those instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1505-0
01:14:51.382 --> 01:14:53.822
<v John Miller>Um, once you once you have.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1510-0
01:14:52.262 --> 01:14:55.456
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, sorry,
maybe I confused you with my question.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1510-1
01:14:55.456 --> 01:15:00.694
<v Majernik, Peter>Let's say I want to do a pre-commit check
and and I want to prevent something bad</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1510-2
01:15:00.694 --> 01:15:03.825
<v Majernik, Peter>happening before the developer actually
commits.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1510-3
01:15:03.825 --> 01:15:08.936
<v Majernik, Peter>So that should trigger some kind of an
action like run all unit tests and check</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1510-4
01:15:08.936 --> 01:15:10.022
<v Majernik, Peter>a bunch of stuff.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1511-0
01:15:10.382 --> 01:15:13.742
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that something I can put in an
instruction file or not really?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1509-0
01:15:11.022 --> 01:15:11.262
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1517-0
01:15:14.582 --> 01:15:18.912
<v John Miller>What if you ask the instruction,
ask the copilot to do that,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1517-1
01:15:18.912 --> 01:15:24.235
<v John Miller>it would actually do a pre-commit hook
and and wire that into the to get a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1517-2
01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:30.198
<v John Miller>GitHub action or you know on Azure DevOps
it would provide you with the instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1517-3
01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:34.102
<v John Miller>to do it because that's an appropriate
place for that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1522-0
01:15:34.102 --> 01:15:38.294
<v John Miller>Kind of constraint.
The instruction files are primarily</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1518-0
01:15:37.022 --> 01:15:37.182
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1522-1
01:15:38.294 --> 01:15:44.133
<v John Miller>oriented at making sure that the code
that you generate because it has to run</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1522-2
01:15:44.133 --> 01:15:50.347
<v John Miller>through because there's nothing going to
stop you from sitting down and opening up</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1522-3
01:15:50.347 --> 01:15:53.342
<v John Miller>a project and writing a lot of bad code.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1526-0
01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:57.804
<v John Miller>That's the AI is not.
The AI is not involved in that process,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1524-0
01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:56.582
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1525-0
01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:57.622
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1526-1
01:15:57.804 --> 01:16:00.942
<v John Miller>right?
You haven't asked it to do anything.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1529-0
01:15:58.862 --> 01:16:01.817
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so basically it's so basically it's not</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1529-1
01:16:01.817 --> 01:16:04.302
<v Majernik, Peter>the right place for what I described.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1534-0
01:16:04.662 --> 01:16:07.338
<v John Miller>No, I wouldn't say. I would say not,
but I you know.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1534-1
01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:11.076
<v John Miller>But if you're doing code generation,
the instruction files are are a good</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1534-2
01:16:11.076 --> 01:16:14.662
<v John Miller>place to put those kinds of rules that
that you want to have enforced.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1533-0
01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:15.502
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1535-0
01:16:17.262 --> 01:16:17.502
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1538-0
01:16:18.582 --> 01:16:22.100
<v John Miller>So in a sense,
it's kind of to your benefit to to ask</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1538-1
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:27.182
<v John Miller>the AI to do the work rather than trying
to do too much of the work yourself.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1540-0
01:16:28.262 --> 01:16:31.222
<v Majernik, Peter>All right. Thank you.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1544-0
01:16:31.902 --> 01:16:36.545
<v John Miller>Sure. All right,
so we're all back on main again.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1544-1
01:16:36.545 --> 01:16:42.582
<v John Miller>So what I'll let's do a prop that says
let's what issue is this?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1547-0
01:16:47.822 --> 01:16:55.182
<v John Miller>Function evaluation overrides and it's a
side effect. The example criteria.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1549-0
01:16:58.102 --> 01:17:00.462
<v John Miller>Problem is more subtle.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1552-0
01:17:04.422 --> 01:17:08.924
<v John Miller>All right,
high severity looks fairly sophisticated,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1552-1
01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:11.982
<v John Miller>so maybe we'll get a chance at this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1554-0
01:17:18.142 --> 01:17:18.462
<v Majernik, Peter>I.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1559-0
01:17:23.782 --> 01:17:28.704
<v John Miller>Yeah, well,
maybe this is maybe my problem is that it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1559-1
01:17:28.704 --> 01:17:29.342
<v John Miller>let me.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1563-0
01:17:32.182 --> 01:17:37.340
<v John Miller>What I'm thinking is that it's going to
find the proposed solution in both models</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1563-1
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:42.499
<v John Miller>and therefore it's going to implement the
proposed solution in the issue file and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1563-2
01:17:42.499 --> 01:17:46.022
<v John Miller>not try to do something in terms of its
own evaluation.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1564-0
01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:48.302
<v John Miller>So maybe.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1566-0
01:17:51.742 --> 01:17:52.062
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1569-0
01:17:57.982 --> 01:18:02.422
<v John Miller>For #12 here, what we'll do instead.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1571-0
01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:08.262
<v John Miller>Is capture the problem statement.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1574-0
01:18:13.102 --> 01:18:17.222
<v John Miller>Let's remove the issue file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1579-0
01:18:19.982 --> 01:18:26.332
<v John Miller>So that it doesn't have a hint.
Let's clear our our our context so</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1579-1
01:18:26.332 --> 01:18:32.778
<v John Miller>there's nothing no clues there.
And we'll do the first attempt with</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1579-2
01:18:32.778 --> 01:18:35.622
<v John Miller>Claude Sonnets and say create.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1580-0
01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:38.422
<v John Miller>A new branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1582-0
01:18:41.302 --> 01:18:43.702
<v John Miller>And implement.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1584-0
01:18:46.182 --> 01:18:46.902
<v John Miller>A6.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1587-0
01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:52.982
<v John Miller>For this log on that branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1593-0
01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:09.422
<v John Miller>I didn't realize the chat window
supported markdown.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1609-0
01:19:49.742 --> 01:19:54.222
<v John Miller>Questions while we're just waiting for
this fix to get implemented.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1612-0
01:20:03.342 --> 01:20:05.102
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1614-0
01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:09.822
<v John Miller>So it's updating a couple of different
files, yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1616-0
01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:14.022
<v John Miller>No, just one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1619-0
01:20:19.302 --> 01:20:22.902
<v John Miller>Just run the test to make sure that we
haven't broken anything.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1626-0
01:20:33.782 --> 01:20:38.870
<v John Miller>I feel sometimes like a play by play
announcer just describing what the AI is</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1626-1
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:39.262
<v John Miller>doing.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1642-0
01:21:08.982 --> 01:21:14.324
<v John Miller>And so looks like we got a bunch of
warnings but no errors.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1642-1
01:21:14.324 --> 01:21:17.262
<v John Miller>And now it's gonna create a test.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1643-0
01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:20.102
<v John Miller>The the bug is actually fixed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1658-0
01:21:56.782 --> 01:22:00.717
<v Majernik, Peter>So so we are fixing the same bug with two
different models.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1658-1
01:22:00.717 --> 01:22:02.422
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that the exercise here?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1659-0
01:22:02.742 --> 01:22:03.702
<v John Miller>That's the exercise here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1662-0
01:22:03.622 --> 01:22:07.344
<v Majernik, Peter>And and then it pushes.
It actually pushes them to the cloud in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1662-1
01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:11.182
<v Majernik, Peter>on the two different branches.
Or is it all local to your laptop?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1665-0
01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:18.315
<v John Miller>Well, it's if we do a, if we do a push,
it'll it'll push it to the to the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1665-1
01:22:18.315 --> 01:22:19.382
<v John Miller>repository.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1666-0
01:22:19.782 --> 01:22:22.142
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, so you didn't do a push yet.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1667-0
01:22:23.102 --> 01:22:23.862
<v John Miller>Not yet.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1670-0
01:22:23.342 --> 01:22:26.342
<v Majernik, Peter>Alright,
so how are you comparing the two branches</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1670-1
01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:29.342
<v Majernik, Peter>or how are we gonna know which solution
is better?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1671-0
01:22:31.262 --> 01:22:31.502
<v John Miller>So...</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1673-0
01:22:34.422 --> 01:22:37.942
<v John Miller>So here it's getting it's actually, uh,
adding uh to the repo.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1675-0
01:22:38.902 --> 01:22:41.222
<v John Miller>Yeah, I'll show you that in a second.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1678-0
01:22:48.462 --> 01:22:49.902
<v John Miller>Here's our commit message.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1679-0
01:22:55.462 --> 01:22:55.622
<v Majernik, Peter>2.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1692-0
01:23:22.262 --> 01:23:26.081
<v John Miller>So there's our first implementation.
It's all done with that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1692-1
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:27.622
<v John Miller>So let's go back to main.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1693-0
01:23:30.542 --> 01:23:31.782
<v John Miller>New York.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1695-0
01:23:34.902 --> 01:23:36.142
<v John Miller>There we go.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1697-0
01:23:37.462 --> 01:23:40.062
<v John Miller>Let's clear our context again.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1699-0
01:23:41.742 --> 01:23:44.942
<v John Miller>So now we have no in our context, no.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1702-0
01:23:46.262 --> 01:23:52.730
<v John Miller>Remnants of the previous request,
so we can change our model now to what do</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1702-1
01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.262
<v John Miller>we say? How about?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1704-0
01:23:55.982 --> 01:23:57.182
<v John Miller>Chat ABT 5.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1706-0
01:24:00.062 --> 01:24:03.382
<v John Miller>And then run the same prompt.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1711-0
01:24:14.742 --> 01:24:17.142
<v Majernik, Peter>Is it smart enough to pick a different
branch name?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1712-0
01:24:20.262 --> 01:24:20.302
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1714-0
01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:25.452
<v Harding, Mike>That's what I was gonna is gonna look at
the fixed file that was just fixed by the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1714-1
01:24:25.452 --> 01:24:25.822
<v Harding, Mike>other.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1720-0
01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:32.050
<v John Miller>Well, well,
it hasn't actually looked at the repo.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1720-1
01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:35.892
<v John Miller>It doesn't know.
Even if it knew what the branch was,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1720-2
01:24:35.892 --> 01:24:39.734
<v John Miller>it wouldn't know necessarily what was on
that branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1720-3
01:24:39.734 --> 01:24:45.283
<v John Miller>And we'll have to be explicit when we
compare about telling it which branches</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1720-4
01:24:45.283 --> 01:24:46.422
<v John Miller>to actually use.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1723-0
01:24:50.902 --> 01:24:56.063
<v John Miller>So here it's looking for tests.
It's still formulating a gathering the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1723-1
01:24:56.063 --> 01:25:00.062
<v John Miller>information it thinks it needs in order
to be able to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1725-0
01:25:03.822 --> 01:25:04.062
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1727-0
01:25:05.662 --> 01:25:08.942
<v John Miller>Determine what the what the root cause is.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1729-0
01:25:13.382 --> 01:25:13.422
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1735-0
01:25:29.942 --> 01:25:31.062
<v John Miller>No, it's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1740-0
01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:48.742
<v John Miller>So what are our two branch names now?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1742-0
01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:56.942
<v John Miller>Someone is ants update after top level,
the other one is fix.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1744-0
01:25:58.102 --> 01:25:59.622
<v John Miller>And update bug.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1755-0
01:26:27.062 --> 01:26:29.542
<v John Miller>I know one thing to note is that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1756-0
01:26:30.542 --> 01:26:32.462
<v John Miller>Since we have instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1760-0
01:26:35.902 --> 01:26:40.289
<v John Miller>It's going to do the implementation of
the bug fix using those in compliance</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1760-1
01:26:40.289 --> 01:26:41.942
<v John Miller>with those instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1762-0
01:26:45.262 --> 01:26:48.862
<v John Miller>So now what it wants us to do is do a get
ad.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1765-0
01:26:52.262 --> 01:26:55.182
<v John Miller>And a commit with a commit message.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1768-0
01:27:00.142 --> 01:27:04.462
<v John Miller>It doesn't look to me like it had created
any new tests, is it?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1770-0
01:27:06.742 --> 01:27:12.622
<v John Miller>So here's the implementing the fix code
changes. They ran the tests.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1774-0
01:27:14.182 --> 01:27:19.010
<v John Miller>It valid,
it validated output and then it changed</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1774-1
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:24.902
<v John Miller>the directory and ran the test and did a
commit and push so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1778-0
01:27:26.862 --> 01:27:31.150
<v John Miller>Cloud was obviously a little more
sophisticated in the sense that he</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1778-1
01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:36.247
<v John Miller>created a a test to ran that test and and
then verified that all those tests were</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1778-2
01:27:36.247 --> 01:27:39.292
<v John Miller>passing.
So now we're doing a a push to push the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1778-3
01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:42.462
<v John Miller>code into the repo.
So let's just do a git branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1780-0
01:27:44.022 --> 01:27:47.502
<v John Miller>to make it easy to gather the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1781-0
01:27:48.982 --> 01:27:49.902
<v John Miller>Uh, branch names.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1783-0
01:27:52.742 --> 01:27:54.062
<v John Miller>Oh, it's still not.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1785-0
01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:57.662
<v John Miller>Hasn't finished its push yet.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1788-0
01:28:08.782 --> 01:28:09.822
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1793-0
01:28:10.902 --> 01:28:19.638
<v John Miller>So there's the two branches like fix ENS
update bug and and fix NS update after</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1793-1
01:28:19.638 --> 01:28:27.502
<v John Miller>top level. So we will clear our contact.
Oh wait, I need to keep first.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1795-0
01:28:33.702 --> 01:28:35.102
<v John Miller>And then um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1799-0
01:28:36.262 --> 01:28:42.697
<v John Miller>Let's clear our context.
Let's change our agents to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1799-1
01:28:42.697 --> 01:28:46.462
<v John Miller>How about Gemini to here? Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1801-0
01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:52.502
<v John Miller>We'll close this. I want my git branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1802-0
01:28:55.662 --> 01:28:56.982
<v John Miller>Looks like I lost it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1804-0
01:29:00.822 --> 01:29:02.222
<v John Miller>Just to give me the list.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1806-0
01:29:03.222 --> 01:29:04.822
<v John Miller>And then we'll say.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1809-0
01:29:10.302 --> 01:29:13.502
<v John Miller>All right, so there's our bug.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1810-0
01:29:15.782 --> 01:29:16.062
<v John Miller>And.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1812-0
01:29:17.542 --> 01:29:19.102
<v John Miller>And they said there.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1814-0
01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:24.182
<v John Miller>There are two different.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1820-0
01:29:31.222 --> 01:29:37.382
<v John Miller>of this log on two branches.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1840-0
01:30:33.902 --> 01:30:35.382
<v John Miller>I have these backwards.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1842-0
01:30:38.542 --> 01:30:41.902
<v John Miller>Oh, and I need to switch. I do.
I did this this.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1845-0
01:30:44.582 --> 01:30:49.742
<v John Miller>This top level one is yeah is GPT.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1846-0
01:30:51.542 --> 01:30:52.102
<v John Miller>5.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1848-0
01:30:53.902 --> 01:30:55.822
<v John Miller>Let me switch back to the main.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1853-0
01:31:08.782 --> 01:31:13.422
<v John Miller>Compare the implementations.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1854-0
01:31:16.502 --> 01:31:16.742
<v John Miller>And.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1856-0
01:31:19.142 --> 01:31:19.622
<v John Miller>Report.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1858-0
01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:28.022
<v John Miller>The pros and cons of each.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1860-0
01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:34.542
<v John Miller>Anybody see any issues with this?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1862-0
01:31:37.862 --> 01:31:39.262
<v Majernik, Peter>Looks fine to me.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1865-0
01:31:40.102 --> 01:31:42.539
<v John Miller>All right,
so this will take a little while 'cause</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1865-1
01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:45.742
<v John Miller>it's gonna have to switch back and forth
between the two branches.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1869-0
01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:57.102
<v John Miller>It's checking to see if the branches
actually exist.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1872-0
01:32:03.262 --> 01:32:06.142
<v John Miller>It's getting a diff of what was changed.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1881-0
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:24.298
<v Majernik, Peter>So have you seen any fully automated
workflows yet where one model generates</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1881-1
01:32:24.298 --> 01:32:30.644
<v Majernik, Peter>the solution for a bug fix and then the
second does the PRS automatically?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1881-2
01:32:30.644 --> 01:32:34.622
<v Majernik, Peter>Or is there a human always involved
somewhere?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1883-0
01:32:35.942 --> 01:32:38.512
<v John Miller>Well, we've been,
we've been seeing it do the commits</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1883-1
01:32:38.512 --> 01:32:41.225
<v John Miller>automatically and and if we had asked it
to create a PR,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1883-2
01:32:41.225 --> 01:32:43.462
<v John Miller>it would have done that automatically as
well.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1886-0
01:32:43.462 --> 01:32:48.652
<v Majernik, Peter>But do you have AI reviewing PRS
automatically without human human</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1885-0
01:32:47.702 --> 01:32:47.982
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1886-1
01:32:48.652 --> 01:32:49.582
<v Majernik, Peter>interaction?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-0
01:32:50.142 --> 01:32:52.582
<v John Miller>Well,
that's what we were talking about</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-1
01:32:52.582 --> 01:32:55.755
<v John Miller>implementing.
It's something that would review a PR</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1888-0
01:32:53.142 --> 01:32:53.342
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-2
01:32:55.755 --> 01:32:59.477
<v John Miller>automatically when you create the PR and
if it finds issues,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-3
01:32:59.477 --> 01:33:04.053
<v John Miller>not allow the PR to be approved.
It would add a comment to the PR and then</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-4
01:33:04.053 --> 01:33:08.751
<v John Miller>set it set the comment has has having to
be resolved before you can actually</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1892-5
01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:09.422
<v John Miller>approve it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1895-0
01:33:10.022 --> 01:33:15.203
<v Majernik, Peter>So if if it found no issues,
we could just have it approve the PR</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1893-0
01:33:10.662 --> 01:33:12.022
<v John Miller>So did you do it?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1895-1
01:33:15.203 --> 01:33:16.302
<v Majernik, Peter>automatically.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1897-0
01:33:19.622 --> 01:33:23.582
<v John Miller>Yeah, if it's on no issues, yeah,
you could do it. You could approve the PR.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1901-0
01:33:24.742 --> 01:33:27.742
<v John Miller>But yeah, that's a little tricky,
you know,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1901-1
01:33:27.742 --> 01:33:31.696
<v John Miller>'cause you know you're having code
generate AI generated,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1901-2
01:33:31.696 --> 01:33:33.742
<v John Miller>having AI review it, you know?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1904-0
01:33:33.262 --> 01:33:35.808
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, I know.
That's why I asked the question.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1904-1
01:33:35.808 --> 01:33:39.546
<v Majernik, Peter>I'm wondering if you have seen any
implementations of this yet where</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1903-0
01:33:38.422 --> 01:33:39.902
<v John Miller>I haven't.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1904-2
01:33:39.546 --> 01:33:42.742
<v Majernik, Peter>somebody decided to do it and it's
effective and it works.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1908-0
01:33:42.822 --> 01:33:48.242
<v John Miller>Well, that's not. I haven't seen it.
I haven't heard it reported that people</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1908-1
01:33:48.242 --> 01:33:51.974
<v John Miller>are doing it, but I'm sure that they are.
You could,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1908-2
01:33:51.974 --> 01:33:57.183
<v John Miller>you could go so far as to have two
different models review it and if they</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1908-3
01:33:57.183 --> 01:33:58.662
<v John Miller>both agree that it's.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1912-0
01:33:58.742 --> 01:34:04.029
<v John Miller>Good. Then then approve it.
Then you get at least some sense that two</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1912-1
01:34:04.029 --> 01:34:08.259
<v John Miller>AI's, two eyes,
two pairs of eyes have looked at it and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1912-2
01:34:08.259 --> 01:34:14.302
<v John Miller>and considered to be a a a good choice
and then let the code review go forward.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1914-0
01:34:15.342 --> 01:34:17.742
<v John Miller>Or look at it at the PR, but um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1918-0
01:34:18.822 --> 01:34:23.822
<v John Miller>And you know that and and to a certain
extent that's done automatically in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1918-1
01:34:23.822 --> 01:34:29.022
<v John Miller>GitHub is that you know they have a
dependabot which will look for dependency</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1918-2
01:34:29.022 --> 01:34:32.222
<v John Miller>updates and automatically create PRS for
those,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1918-3
01:34:32.222 --> 01:34:34.822

01:35:32.083 --> 01:35:37.931
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>philosophical discussion,
but let's not forget that we operate in a</v>

01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:42.918

And so to apply maybe my lenses or my</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1940-3
01:35:42.918 --> 01:35:48.422
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>contacts is would I like my significant

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1944-0
01:35:48.622 --> 01:35:57.111
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Piece of surgery with software generated

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1944-1
01:35:57.111 --> 01:35:57.422
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>no.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1950-0
01:35:58.422 --> 01:36:02.572
<v John Miller>I would concur with that.
I would feel comfortable with that as</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1950-1
01:36:02.572 --> 01:36:06.528
<v John Miller>well. I think it's imperative,
as we talked about yesterday,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1950-2
01:36:06.528 --> 01:36:11.132
<v John Miller>that we keep a human in the loop to
review the code before it goes in.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1946-0
01:36:07.982 --> 01:36:08.142
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1950-3
01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:15.542
<v John Miller>What I think the A I can do though,
it can find the problems first.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1954-0
01:36:16.102 --> 01:36:20.555
<v John Miller>Right. So by the time it gets to you,
all of the things that we've described in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1949-0
01:36:16.142 --> 01:36:17.662
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>That's right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1954-1
01:36:20.555 --> 01:36:22.782
<v John Miller>the instruction files are all compliant.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1958-0
01:36:25.222 --> 01:36:29.268
<v John Miller>All the things that we do in a pre-commit

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1958-1
01:36:29.268 --> 01:36:33.540
<v John Miller>Then a human can look at the PR and say,
all right, so I I've looked at it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1958-2
01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:36.294
<v John Miller>I know that these other things have
checked out.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1958-3
01:36:36.294 --> 01:36:40.622
<v John Miller>Let me focus on the things that it's not
checking that I need to to look at.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1959-0
01:36:41.422 --> 01:36:41.662
<v John Miller>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1964-0
01:36:43.582 --> 01:36:50.883
<v John Miller>You know that might you know there's this,
there's this concept about AI software</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1964-1
01:36:50.883 --> 01:36:55.068
<v John Miller>engineers,
which is not a AI that's a software</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1964-2
01:36:55.068 --> 01:37:01.302
<v John Miller>engineer that's creating AI,
but a software engineer which is an A I.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1968-0
01:37:01.542 --> 01:37:06.246
<v John Miller>Which can take on.
You can assign it a work item and it will</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1968-1
01:37:06.246 --> 01:37:12.415
<v John Miller>take that work item all the way through
the determining of what the issue is to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1968-2
01:37:12.415 --> 01:37:17.119
<v John Miller>creating a plan to address the issue,
implementing the plan,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1968-3
01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:18.662
<v John Miller>testing the results.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1973-0
01:37:19.062 --> 01:37:23.756
<v John Miller>Creating a PR and then pushing that PR.
You know it's feasible at some point that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1973-1
01:37:23.756 --> 01:37:28.106
<v John Miller>if you get other AIS to review that and
and really focus those AIS with the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1973-2
01:37:28.106 --> 01:37:32.514
<v John Miller>instructions that are specifically
targeted to the things that it's supposed</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1973-3
01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:35.891
<v John Miller>to be looking for,
which is completely out of the scope of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1973-4
01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:38.582
<v John Miller>what you actually used to try to to
create it.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1977-0
01:37:38.662 --> 01:37:41.924
<v John Miller>And that would, I think,
go a long way to making sure that you</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1977-1
01:37:41.924 --> 01:37:45.600
<v John Miller>feel comfortable with it. And if you,
you know, The thing is that you,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1977-2
01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.846
<v John Miller>you worry about just one thing slipping
through the cracks and there's nothing in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1977-3
01:37:49.846 --> 01:37:53.885
<v John Miller>the pipeline that's going to catch it.
And that's the that's where you really</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1977-4
01:37:53.885 --> 01:37:56.422
<v John Miller>have to have strong confidence in your
pipeline.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1978-0
01:37:58.342 --> 01:37:59.822
<v Majernik, Peter>Makes sense.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1979-0
01:37:58.622 --> 01:37:59.822
<v John Miller>Alright, when it is fine.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1981-0
01:38:01.422 --> 01:38:01.502
<v Majernik, Peter>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1983-0
01:38:02.422 --> 01:38:05.986
<v John Miller>So he so that is it didn't actually take
too long.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1983-1
01:38:05.986 --> 01:38:08.782
<v John Miller>It's it looked at compare the bug fixes.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1987-0
01:38:10.302 --> 01:38:15.170
<v John Miller>So it approved the creation of a branch
by the get get branch rule.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1987-1
01:38:15.170 --> 01:38:20.182
<v John Miller>So it did a lot of this on its own.
It gets the diff for each branch.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1991-0
01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:25.640
<v John Miller>Right,
so here it's getting it from each each</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1991-1
01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.189
<v John Miller>different branch,
does a comparison between the two</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1991-2
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:34.306
<v John Miller>implementations fixing the AI bug,
and so the core issue was being updated</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1991-3
01:38:34.306 --> 01:38:37.582
<v John Miller>during the evaluation of the Nexus

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1995-0
01:38:37.862 --> 01:38:42.704
<v John Miller>And the desire behaviour is that it
updated only once after the entire</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/1995-1
01:38:42.704 --> 01:38:47.001

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2006-0
01:39:18.382 --> 01:39:21.673
<v John Miller>A clear separation of concerns,
explicit and readable.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2006-1
01:39:21.673 --> 01:39:26.221
<v John Miller>A single point of mutation cons code
duplication and introduce a new method</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2006-2
01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:30.230
<v John Miller>that largely duplicates the code of the

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2006-3
01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:33.582
<v John Miller>While the logic is separated,
the code is very similar.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2009-0
01:39:33.782 --> 01:39:36.554
<v John Miller>Then it takes a look at the ChatGPT 5
approach.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2009-1
01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:41.290
<v John Miller>The implementation modifies the existing

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2009-2
01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:44.062
<v John Miller>to control whether the update state is

01:39:45.462 --> 01:39:48.858
<v John Miller>Right,
the evaluate method is overloaded a new</v>

01:39:55.968 --> 01:39:59.951
<v John Miller>is wrapped in a if statement.
The public static decimal evaluate method</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2015-2
01:39:59.951 --> 01:40:02.662

<v John Miller>consolidated logic cons.
Boolean flags can be unclear control</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2020-3
01:40:17.182 --> 01:40:20.109
<v John Miller>coupling.
The caller is now responsible for</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2020-4
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:23.902
<v John Miller>dictating the internal behaviour of the
evaluate method.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2024-0
01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:29.305
<v John Miller>And there's mental overhead in terms of
adding complexity to the evaluate method</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2024-1
01:40:29.305 --> 01:40:32.517
<v John Miller>itself.
Now every new one reading it has to track</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2024-2
01:40:32.517 --> 01:40:37.463
<v John Miller>the state of the update memory and
history flag to understand the code flow.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2024-3
01:40:37.463 --> 01:40:39.262
<v John Miller>What is its recommendations?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2028-0
01:40:39.462 --> 01:40:42.391
<v John Miller>Both branches correctly fixed the bug.
However,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2028-1
01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:46.908
<v John Miller>the cloud side approach is preferable
from a software design perspective.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2028-2
01:40:46.908 --> 01:40:51.608
<v John Miller>It introduces some code duplication.
It results in a cleaner, more readable,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2028-3
01:40:51.608 --> 01:40:55.392
<v John Miller>more maintainable solution,
and the separation of concerns is</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2028-4
01:40:55.392 --> 01:40:55.942
<v John Miller>explicit.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2029-0
01:40:56.142 --> 01:40:56.222
<v John Miller>So.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2032-0
01:40:59.622 --> 01:41:02.526
<v John Miller>So here you could then say, OK,
I like that branch and then you could</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2032-1
01:41:02.526 --> 01:41:05.182
<v John Miller>merge that branch back into main.
So what do you think of that?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2033-0
01:41:07.582 --> 01:41:08.862
<v Majernik, Peter>It's nice.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2037-0
01:41:16.222 --> 01:41:19.742
<v John Miller>Cool. Any other comments on it?
I think it's pretty neat.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2040-0
01:41:20.182 --> 01:41:26.822
<v Carter, Jake>So if you say you had like 2 models that
each like produce two different solutions</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2040-1
01:41:26.822 --> 01:41:29.862
<v Carter, Jake>and you ask one of the models to like.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2043-0
01:41:31.622 --> 01:41:35.223
<v Carter, Jake>Judge them between each other.
Would it like always judge its always</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2043-1
01:41:35.223 --> 01:41:38.302
<v Carter, Jake>like say that its own solution was the
best, do you think?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2046-0
01:41:39.462 --> 01:41:42.316
<v Carter, Jake>It's like for here,
like Cloud Sonic would, uh,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2045-0
01:41:39.702 --> 01:41:40.942
<v John Miller>Well, we could.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2046-1
01:41:42.316 --> 01:41:43.982
<v Carter, Jake>I guess we could try it too.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2049-0
01:41:43.902 --> 01:41:48.367
<v John Miller>So you can try it right now.
We could say I'll I'll use Cloud Sonnets</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2049-1
01:41:48.367 --> 01:41:50.982
<v John Miller>to do the evaluation right and then just.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2050-0
01:41:49.622 --> 01:41:53.542
<v Carter, Jake>But we'll try the the one that that had
the worst approach.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2055-0
01:41:53.342 --> 01:41:59.249
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's change that to Chat GTB 5 and let's</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2055-1
01:41:59.249 --> 01:42:05.852
<v John Miller>clear our context so it doesn't know
anything about the previous evaluation</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2055-2
01:42:05.852 --> 01:42:10.022
<v John Miller>and let's go ahead and have it go and run
that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2056-0
01:42:10.542 --> 01:42:11.942
<v John Miller>Analysis.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2061-0
01:42:13.622 --> 01:42:17.610
<v John Miller>Yeah, I did.
I find I'd do more of this kind of model</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2061-1
01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:23.371
<v John Miller>by model comparison and this could be
something that you can work into a chat</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2061-2
01:42:23.371 --> 01:42:29.132
<v John Miller>mode where you give it a prompt and it
would go through the whole workflow of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2061-3
01:42:29.132 --> 01:42:33.342
<v John Miller>doing the two implementations,
doing the comparison and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2063-0
01:42:33.582 --> 01:42:39.303
<v John Miller>The result and then you just you then you
can review the branch that it preferred</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2063-1
01:42:39.303 --> 01:42:39.582
<v John Miller>and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2066-0
01:42:43.062 --> 01:42:47.542
<v John Miller>And and review that code, right?
And then prove that code when you.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2068-0
01:42:49.662 --> 01:42:52.816
<v John Miller>Notice it's constantly having to change
directories.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2068-1
01:42:52.816 --> 01:42:54.662
<v John Miller>It's getting better about that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2070-0
01:42:55.622 --> 01:43:00.142
<v John Miller>In terms of remembering to actually
approve auto approve those things.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2082-0
01:43:19.502 --> 01:43:24.302
<v John Miller>Here it's pulling them down and doing a
def of them.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2084-0
01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:29.982
<v John Miller>Same same as what the other model did.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2091-0
01:43:45.782 --> 01:43:47.822
<v John Miller>And now let's do the analysis.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2099-0
01:44:05.742 --> 01:44:08.302
<v John Miller>And it's possible that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2101-0
01:44:10.502 --> 01:44:12.942
<v John Miller>The the Gemini model.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2103-0
01:44:15.982 --> 01:44:20.142
<v John Miller>Had some bias as well that would favor
one model or the other.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2109-0
01:44:33.462 --> 01:44:33.662
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2111-0
01:44:40.582 --> 01:44:42.622
<v John Miller>So he gave us a depends, I think.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2115-0
01:44:44.022 --> 01:44:49.641
<v John Miller>Optional refinement suggested for the
ChatGPT approach tradeoff summarize.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2115-1
01:44:49.641 --> 01:44:54.062
<v John Miller>It wants to. It wants to use ChatGPT.
That's pretty funny.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2117-0
01:44:59.902 --> 01:45:00.622
<v John Miller>But um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2122-0
01:45:10.102 --> 01:45:13.418
<v John Miller>It wants to.
It wants to improve it by keeping the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2122-1
01:45:13.418 --> 01:45:17.711
<v John Miller>single private overload,
but change the flag to enum and keep the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2122-2
01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.662
<v John Miller>named arguments at call sites.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2124-0
01:45:22.662 --> 01:45:25.902
<v John Miller>Says that it would improve the
readability.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2128-0
01:45:26.222 --> 01:45:29.963
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, I I mean, I don't wanna,
I don't think it's worth running through</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2128-1
01:45:29.963 --> 01:45:32.250
<v Carter, Jake>this,
but it is sort of interesting that it</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2128-2
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:35.160
<v Carter, Jake>it's like its own.
I wonder if at the beginning of this</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2128-3
01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.382
<v Carter, Jake>prompt you told it which one it was from
chat cheap, I guess.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2130-0
01:45:39.342 --> 01:45:42.145
<v John Miller>Oh yeah, I I did because you know,
we could,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2130-1
01:45:42.145 --> 01:45:47.128
<v John Miller>we could run it again without the without
the prompt telling it which model was</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2136-0
01:45:46.342 --> 01:45:50.735
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, it's some sort of ego.
But also I think before you were saying</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2130-2
01:45:47.128 --> 01:45:47.502
<v John Miller>which.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2136-1
01:45:50.735 --> 01:45:55.574
<v Carter, Jake>that it sort of seems like the agent
doesn't even know which model it uses,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2136-2
01:45:55.574 --> 01:46:00.222
<v Carter, Jake>but I know that sometimes they don't,
they don't tell the the truth, so.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2133-0
01:45:55.622 --> 01:45:55.742
<v John Miller>OK.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2134-0
01:45:58.542 --> 01:45:58.862
<v John Miller>That.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2138-0
01:46:01.262 --> 01:46:05.262
<v John Miller>Right, right, right. Yeah. And</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2139-0
01:46:04.262 --> 01:46:06.502
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, I don't know. Just this interesting.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2145-0
01:46:06.502 --> 01:46:10.727
<v John Miller>Well, it, you know, it could be,
it could be a bias that's built into the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2145-1
01:46:10.727 --> 01:46:15.009
<v John Miller>model itself in terms of the how the
different coding examples that it was</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2145-2
01:46:15.009 --> 01:46:18.664
<v John Miller>trained on were weighted.
It would would cause it to prefer the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2145-3
01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:21.462
<v John Miller>kinds of implementations that it creates,
right?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2144-0
01:46:20.662 --> 01:46:21.022
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2149-0
01:46:23.142 --> 01:46:26.750
<v John Miller>So,
so using a a third party to do the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2149-1
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:30.914
<v John Miller>evaluation will help eliminate those
biases,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2149-2
01:46:30.914 --> 01:46:38.502
<v John Miller>but you're still stuck with the biases of
the of that model if if that model was.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2154-0
01:46:38.942 --> 01:46:44.139
<v John Miller>You know, so now, so now you can compare,
you know the evaluations of different</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2154-1
01:46:44.139 --> 01:46:47.777
<v John Miller>using different models to evaluate it
like like we did,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2154-2
01:46:47.777 --> 01:46:51.999
<v John Miller>but use different third party ones and
see which one, which one,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2154-3
01:46:51.999 --> 01:46:56.222
<v John Miller>which what it likes and what it doesn't
like and then you could.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2158-0
01:46:57.302 --> 01:47:02.022
<v John Miller>See which one it more closely aligns to
your preferences,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2158-1
01:47:02.022 --> 01:47:08.453
<v John Miller>so it where its biases align better with
your biases and and your preferences,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2158-2
01:47:08.453 --> 01:47:13.662
<v John Miller>and then use that to do all your
evaluations. So you might use.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2160-0
01:47:13.982 --> 01:47:21.819
<v John Miller>A model like Claude because it has a
larger context window to do more complex</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2160-1
01:47:21.819 --> 01:47:22.422
<v John Miller>tasks.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2163-0
01:47:23.382 --> 01:47:28.582
<v John Miller>But this this code comparison is only
comparing two small snippets of code as</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2163-1
01:47:28.582 --> 01:47:31.782
<v John Miller>opposed to the whole code,
the whole code base.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2166-0
01:47:36.102 --> 01:47:38.392
<v John Miller>All right,
let's go jump back to the slides real</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2166-1
01:47:38.392 --> 01:47:40.262
<v John Miller>quick, because I think we're just about.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2167-0
01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:43.782
<v John Miller>At a time, is that correct?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2169-0
01:47:44.782 --> 01:47:44.862
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2174-0
01:47:50.822 --> 01:47:54.056
<v John Miller>Alright,
so we talked about Evergreen for software</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2174-1
01:47:54.056 --> 01:47:59.066
<v John Miller>development and creating creating prompt
files that will create an instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2174-2
01:47:59.066 --> 01:48:03.822
<v John Miller>files for Evergreen software development.
So here was a prompt to create a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2174-3
01:48:03.822 --> 01:48:06.422
<v John Miller>Evergreen instruction prompt to actually.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2176-0
01:48:06.422 --> 01:48:13.468
<v John Miller>Create a prompt that creates a prompt or
creates an instruction file that can be</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2176-1
01:48:13.468 --> 01:48:15.382
<v John Miller>used and meta prompts.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2179-0
01:48:16.942 --> 01:48:22.422
<v John Miller>So I have a couple examples of those.
It's a bit odd.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2184-0
01:48:26.302 --> 01:48:30.035
<v John Miller>Which one is those? And here,
here they are under meta.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2184-1
01:48:30.035 --> 01:48:34.502
<v John Miller>I've got a couple of them that I've
created and there's there's an</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2184-2
01:48:34.502 --> 01:48:39.568
<v John Miller>interesting use case for these. I mean,
typically when you create a prompt,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2184-3
01:48:39.568 --> 01:48:43.502
<v John Miller>there's a whole bunch of prompts here
that we can discuss.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2185-0
01:48:43.862 --> 01:48:43.982
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2190-0
01:48:46.022 --> 01:48:49.324
<v John Miller>When we create a prompt,
we can just create a prompt file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2190-1
01:48:49.324 --> 01:48:52.682
<v John Miller>That should be enough.
We can modify the prompt file if our</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2190-2
01:48:52.682 --> 01:48:55.537
<v John Miller>needs change.
But what I found when I was creating</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2190-3
01:48:55.537 --> 01:48:59.735
<v John Miller>these prompts that they all start off
with a simple prompt like what we're</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2190-4
01:48:59.735 --> 01:49:02.422
<v John Miller>talking about here,
a relatively simple prompt.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2193-0
01:49:03.702 --> 01:49:06.164
<v John Miller>And I want to then I have this urge to
say,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2193-1
01:49:06.164 --> 01:49:09.801
<v John Miller>well if this is a prompt and I want to
may want to run it again,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2193-2
01:49:09.801 --> 01:49:13.382
<v John Miller>then I want to create a prompt file out
of it. So I would take.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2194-0
01:49:14.502 --> 01:49:16.662
<v John Miller>Well, that this number is that.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2195-0
01:49:17.782 --> 01:49:19.462
<v John Miller>Think it's in the other.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2198-0
01:49:20.582 --> 01:49:23.902
<v John Miller>Project.
Let me give a look at our history.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2203-0
01:49:34.222 --> 01:49:37.708
<v John Miller>Uh,
I don't think we've used this to create a</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2203-1
01:49:37.708 --> 01:49:38.542
<v John Miller>prompt yet.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2205-0
01:49:39.582 --> 01:49:42.862
<v John Miller>So why don't we do?
Why don't we do that with our?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2207-0
01:49:46.302 --> 01:49:46.462
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2210-0
01:49:48.182 --> 01:49:53.702
<v John Miller>Or this one you can take this and say
create a prompt.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2212-0
01:49:55.662 --> 01:49:59.822
<v John Miller>File or um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2214-0
01:50:05.622 --> 01:50:06.662
<v John Miller>That creates.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2217-0
01:50:09.462 --> 01:50:13.281
<v John Miller>Well, first of all,
let's just create the instruction file</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2217-1
01:50:13.281 --> 01:50:14.382
<v John Miller>that creates the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2218-0
01:50:15.422 --> 01:50:17.302
<v John Miller>An instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2220-0
01:50:21.662 --> 01:50:21.982
<v John Miller>That.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2222-0
01:50:23.742 --> 01:50:27.902
<v John Miller>Reviews the code base for bugs and
creates issues.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2231-0
01:50:49.942 --> 01:50:51.873
<v John Miller>Alright,
so now it's going to go ahead and</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2231-1
01:50:51.873 --> 01:50:54.702
<v John Miller>actually create a file and it should go
into our props folder.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2242-0
01:51:15.622 --> 01:51:20.998
<v John Miller>And then we can use that prompt to create
this instruction file anytime that we</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2242-1
01:51:20.998 --> 01:51:24.089
<v John Miller>want.
And the the the benefit of that is that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2242-2
01:51:24.089 --> 01:51:27.382
<v John Miller>we can run this prompt in a project and
it will.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2247-0
01:51:28.742 --> 01:51:33.031
<v John Miller>Use our instructions for that,
but it also include anything else in in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2247-1
01:51:33.031 --> 01:51:37.079
<v John Miller>its context that would cause us to want
to update the prompt file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2247-2
01:51:37.079 --> 01:51:42.033
<v John Miller>So one of the things that's interesting
is that the instruction files are kind of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2247-3
01:51:42.033 --> 01:51:45.054
<v John Miller>static.
What you can do is you can actually apply</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2247-4
01:51:45.054 --> 01:51:46.142
<v John Miller>a prompt and says.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2252-0
01:51:46.862 --> 01:51:51.424
<v John Miller>Take a look at this instruction file and
make suggestions for improving it based</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2252-1
01:51:51.424 --> 01:51:54.859
<v John Miller>on the latest best practices or something
along those lines,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2252-2
01:51:54.859 --> 01:51:59.534
<v John Miller>and it will then suggest modifications to
your instruction files that will then in</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2252-3
01:51:59.534 --> 01:52:03.927
<v John Miller>turn you can apply to your code and see
where in your code no longer complies</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2252-4
01:52:03.927 --> 01:52:06.462
<v John Miller>with your instruction files and you need
to.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2255-0
01:52:06.582 --> 01:52:12.297
<v John Miller>Then create backlog items to upgrade your
code to keep it more Evergreen.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2255-1
01:52:12.297 --> 01:52:16.622
<v John Miller>So do we have a new file yet? Yeah,
it looks like here.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2256-0
01:52:18.582 --> 01:52:21.302
<v John Miller>Here is a prompt that will create an
instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2258-0
01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:24.422
<v John Miller>And in the meta case.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2264-0
01:52:25.542 --> 01:52:30.617
<v John Miller>I I felt like OK,
this prompt that I have here could also</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2264-1
01:52:30.617 --> 01:52:37.267
<v John Miller>be a a a prompt file because I may want
to update the prompt file itself to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2264-2
01:52:37.267 --> 01:52:44.267
<v John Miller>include new instructions or include new
things that I've from other places that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2264-3
01:52:44.267 --> 01:52:45.142
<v John Miller>I've I've.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2265-0
01:52:45.222 --> 01:52:48.542
<v John Miller>Learned that it should be incorporated
into the prompts.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2268-0
01:52:50.542 --> 01:52:56.251
<v John Miller>So here this this contains a detailed
instructions on how to create that prompt</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2268-1
01:52:56.251 --> 01:52:57.822
<v John Miller>that instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2273-0
01:53:02.662 --> 01:53:08.957
<v John Miller>All right, in the time we have lane left,
let's I'm just going to go over a few of</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2273-1
01:53:08.957 --> 01:53:14.645
<v John Miller>these prompts that I've created.
The test gap and Dallas one is is looking</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2273-2
01:53:14.645 --> 01:53:16.542
<v John Miller>at the current code base.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2277-0
01:53:17.422 --> 01:53:22.661
<v John Miller>What tests are needed and are missing?
So this will do an evaluation of the code</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2277-1
01:53:22.661 --> 01:53:27.771
<v John Miller>base and determine where in the code base
you could use some additional tasks,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2277-2
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:30.811
<v John Miller>do a security audit,
looking at the code base,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2277-3
01:53:30.811 --> 01:53:35.662
<v John Miller>what are the security concerns and create
get up issues for your findings.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2282-0
01:53:36.622 --> 01:53:40.818
<v John Miller>Do a refactor analysis looking at the
current code base.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2282-1
01:53:40.818 --> 01:53:45.971
<v John Miller>So what what what could you use?
What code could you use refactoring?</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2282-2
01:53:45.971 --> 01:53:49.579
<v John Miller>So and you can see you know what the
inputs are,</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2282-3
01:53:49.579 --> 01:53:55.247
<v John Miller>what what are the the kinds of things
that it's looking for when determining</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2282-4
01:53:55.247 --> 01:53:55.542
<v John Miller>the.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2284-0
01:53:56.302 --> 01:53:59.742
<v John Miller>What should be refactored? Here's um.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2288-0
01:54:00.822 --> 01:54:05.435
<v John Miller>Analyze the files in the instructions.
This is the one I was talking about</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2288-1
01:54:05.435 --> 01:54:08.326
<v John Miller>before.
Folder report where they are no longer</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2288-2
01:54:08.326 --> 01:54:12.694
<v John Miller>represent best practices and create
GitHub issues for instruction file</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2288-3
01:54:12.694 --> 01:54:15.462
<v John Miller>updates. This is a very simple one.
It says.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2293-0
01:54:16.062 --> 01:54:25.548
<v John Miller>Basically to in terms of analyzing the
the, the tools are installed.</v>

01:54:25.548 --> 01:54:34.622
<v John Miller>This is the generate instructions prompt.
It actually produces a.</v>

01:54:35.062 --> 01:54:39.742
<v John Miller>An instruction file that will guide.</v>

01:54:41.142 --> 01:54:48.892
<v John Miller>That will that that will guide the the
creation of instruction files and there's</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2299-1
01:54:48.892 --> 01:54:53.102
<v John Miller>a corresponding one for generating
prompts.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2302-0
01:54:54.862 --> 01:54:59.257
<v John Miller>This one we'll talk about tomorrow.
I like. I like this one.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2302-1
01:54:59.257 --> 01:55:05.093
<v John Miller>Look at the code base and create a GitHub
issues for any any code dead code that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2302-2
01:55:05.093 --> 01:55:05.742
<v John Miller>you find.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2306-0
01:55:09.422 --> 01:55:14.556
<v John Miller>Create prompts instructions.
This will create the prompt instruction</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2306-1
01:55:14.556 --> 01:55:20.062
<v John Miller>file that will be up in the prompts.
Here is the prompt instruction file.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2311-0
01:55:22.422 --> 01:55:25.678
<v John Miller>This one will look for deviations between
the instruction files.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2311-1
01:55:25.678 --> 01:55:29.184
<v John Miller>I think I talked about that.
Here's the one and the one that I talked</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2311-2
01:55:29.184 --> 01:55:31.438
<v John Miller>about.
I thought is that once you've got all</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2311-3
01:55:31.438 --> 01:55:35.446
<v John Miller>your instruction files as you add them,
you can then do a quality check on your</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2311-4
01:55:35.446 --> 01:55:38.502
<v John Miller>instruction files and have the AI
actually look at them and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2315-0
01:55:38.942 --> 01:55:44.179
<v John Miller>And suggest modifications or places where
they can be improved.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2315-1
01:55:44.179 --> 01:55:50.152
<v John Miller>And that's what I've done with many of
these instruction files that I've</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2315-2
01:55:50.152 --> 01:55:55.062
<v John Miller>generated is run it through this check
context prompts and.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2319-0
01:55:55.262 --> 01:56:00.244
<v John Miller>And use it to actually improve the
quality of the instructions. All right.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2319-1
01:56:00.244 --> 01:56:04.496
<v John Miller>So that's it for today.
Tomorrow I'm going to talk about how to</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2319-2
01:56:04.496 --> 01:56:08.615
<v John Miller>do a Greenfield development.
And when you're doing Greenfield</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2319-3
01:56:08.615 --> 01:56:10.542
<v John Miller>development, we need to tell.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2324-0
01:56:10.622 --> 01:56:15.418
<v John Miller>The AI what to build and how to build it.
So we're going to talk about some</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2324-1
01:56:15.418 --> 01:56:20.278
<v John Miller>instruction files and some other files
related to defining requirements that</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2324-2
01:56:20.278 --> 01:56:23.245
<v John Miller>will be used.
We can use actually to guide the</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2324-3
01:56:23.245 --> 01:56:26.022
<v John Miller>implementation of a Greenfield
application.</v>

d57ac704-7f51-4522-8457-605d81efc197/2326-0
01:56:28.862 --> 01:56:31.222
<v John Miller>All right, I'll see you in the morning.</v>
