674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/62-0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
right,
so let's talk about our agenda for today.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/62-1
00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:08.186
So I want to start off talking about what
it is and isn't legacy code and just

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/62-2
00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:13.175
getting a sense of of what that means.
Then we'll talk a bit about, you know,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/62-3
00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:18.164
before we actually start working with
Copilot to change code, what we should.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/63-0
00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:23.113
Think about doing with our hand.
We'll talk more about managing Copilot

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/63-1
00:00:23.113 --> 00:00:26.427
contexts.
I have some interesting information on

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/63-2
00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:29.199
that.
Then we'll get into some read-only

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/63-3
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.324
techniques since we're working in a
legacy code environment.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/64-0
00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:37.653
And the rules are are quite a bit
different than what we were doing

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/64-1
00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:38.844
yesterday by coding.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/66-0
00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.615
Isn't as a excuse me,
isn't it a effective in a legacy

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/66-1
00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:48.702
environment because you know your code is
running in production and you don't want

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/66-2
00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:53.851
to do anything that would affect that. So.
So we want to go through a bunch of read

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/66-3
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.444
only techniques that will.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/67-0
00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:01.959
Help us understand the understand the
code better and you know plan what we're

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/67-1
00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:07.611
going to be doing and you know create
things like tests and stuff like that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/67-2
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:11.404
which don't affect the production
application but.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/68-0
00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:17.160
Allow us to move the code base forward.
Then we'll talk about modifying that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/68-1
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.276
legacy code with AI and then we'll and
then managing some change for us.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/68-2
00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:26.972
How do we deal with, for example,
when techniques change or as the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/68-3
00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.724
technology moves forward?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/69-0
00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:35.162
Just that fact alone by not not keeping
up with the with the current technologies

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/69-1
00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:41.209
our our our code can you know our our
code can decay just just for the for the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/69-2
00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.884
fact that we don't actually keep it up to
date.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/70-0
00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:48.594
For working legacy code,
I would recommend this.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/70-1
00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:53.011
Did you take a look at this book?
It's been out for quite a while.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/70-2
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:57.692
Here it's in thearchive.org.
You can get an E pub version of it and it

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/70-3
00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:00.724
it goes through a whole series of steps
that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/71-0
00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:06.384
Or strategies that you can use to take a
legacy code base and modernize it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/71-1
00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:12.331
I'm not going to go into into the the the
techniques and strategies that that he

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/71-2
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:18.204
recommends outside of the the first one,
which is you know you need more tests.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/73-0
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:24.892
But but this the techniques in this book
are are implementable using the AI

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/73-1
00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:31.469
technique that can help you actually move
forward more quickly in implementing

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/73-2
00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.884
these strategies.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/74-0
00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:40.576
All right then.
So we talked about forking the repos.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/74-1
00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:46.555
I think we'll skip that.
And for let's let's talk a bit about the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/74-2
00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:52.263
target repo I have.
We can work in basically two target repos.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/74-3
00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:55.524
One I have is a repo that I've used.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/75-0
00:02:55.524 --> 00:03:01.411
For quite for a little while on this
topic that I created in an early stage of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/75-1
00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:06.926
development of an application for
internal use of code and it has I would

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/75-2
00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:12.664
consider it a target rich environment for
improvement as well as we have our

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/75-3
00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:13.484
calculator.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/76-0
00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:17.317
An example.
So we can probably bounce back and forth

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/76-1
00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:22.376
between those two and demonstrate most of
the techniques I'll be talking about

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/76-2
00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.769
using them.
But if you're looking for something that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/76-3
00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.906
you can actually use that's different
from this,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/76-4
00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:33.644
you can basically use a prompt like I'm
pointing out here that says I go.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/77-0
00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:39.924
Go ahead and get me a a GitHub coding
project that has a lot of open issues.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/77-1
00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:42.804
Did anybody get a chance to do that?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/78-0
00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:48.164
Uh, that's fine. All right, so.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/79-0
00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:50.164
Thing I I forked where the Zeus.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/80-0
00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:52.124
Oh, did you?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/81-0
00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:53.204
Yeah.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/82-0
00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:54.964
All right, cool.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/83-0
00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:56.284
Um.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/84-0
00:03:58.084 --> 00:04:05.205
So no universally accepted definition.
It's sometimes easier to find,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/84-1
00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:09.884
but is not legacy code.
Let's switch over to.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/85-0
00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.004
This guy, yeah.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/86-0
00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:22.011
And I think this is kind of an
interesting exercise.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/86-1
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:26.884
We can go into our quick chat here and
say give me.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/87-0
00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.724
Uh, the three definitions.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/88-0
00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:32.044
Oh.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/89-0
00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:36.844
Legacy code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/90-0
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:56.172
So there's our three definitions.
Code without test, outdated code,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/90-1
00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:58.204
inherited code. We can.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/91-0
00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:04.380
Say, well,
I don't want just three to give me 10

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/91-1
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.364
definitions of legacy code and.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/92-0
00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:13.541
Now it's added under maintainable code,
hard to understand code,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/92-1
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.185
business critical code,
code with technical debt,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/92-2
00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:22.724
non-standard code, code with poor design,
code dependent on legacy systems.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/93-0
00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:27.844
25 definitions of legacy code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/95-0
00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:39.013
And that will expand more,
more reasons why code can become a legacy.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/95-1
00:05:39.013 --> 00:05:46.521
We can see that there's lots of different
aspects to a legacy code that we're and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/95-2
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:49.084
from these definitions have.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/96-0
00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:52.044
And and you worked in a legacy code base.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/97-0
00:05:56.764 --> 00:05:58.484
Yes, I have for a few.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/98-0
00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:00.044
Yes.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/101-0
00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:04.969
I'm sure,
I'm sure we all have at some point worked

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/100-0
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:02.164
Y Yes.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/99-0
00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:02.204
And.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/101-1
00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.624
in legacy to code because as we saw
yesterday,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/101-2
00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:13.991
it's very easy for code to to to go to go
from Greenfield to legacy.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/101-3
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:16.324
It doesn't take long for that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/102-0
00:06:16.524 --> 00:06:22.386
To for that to happen.
So let's turn the question around and say

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/102-1
00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:26.084
OK, give me 3 difference of code of code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/103-0
00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:28.564
That is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/104-0
00:06:31.844 --> 00:06:32.044
No.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/105-0
00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:34.124
Legacy.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/106-0
00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:46.434
And so,
so it's come back with modern code,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/106-1
00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:54.540
tested code and a well documented code.
And we're going to see that this is going

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/106-2
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.604
to be largely the inverse, but.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/107-0
00:06:57.964 --> 00:07:03.419
The the idea is on not legacy code is
that we want to make sure that the code

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/107-1
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.825
is basically up to date,
well and well documented and has good

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/107-2
00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:09.084
tests. So this is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/108-0
00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:15.943
What we are interested and then we can do
something very similar and say, OK,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/108-1
00:07:15.943 --> 00:07:18.524
what are the definitions of Evergreen?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/109-0
00:07:21.684 --> 00:07:22.324
Code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/114-0
00:07:29.444 --> 00:07:34.526
So this is continuously updated.
It's future proof in a well documented,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/114-1
00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:38.354
well tested.
So we we can see that testing is a common

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/114-2
00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:42.113
theme here.
Either you don't have enough of it or you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/114-3
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:47.542
are you have well tested code or and
that's something that we we want to make

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/114-4
00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.004
sure that we we keep.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/115-0
00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:55.164
Take advantage of.
So let's go back to our slides.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/116-0
00:07:57.404 --> 00:08:01.723
So not like you see code think think
about is they all started,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/116-1
00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:05.434
you know all code starts as Greenfield,
but few codes,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/116-2
00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:09.348
code bases are able to maintain that
server green status.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/116-3
00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:13.802
And the reason for that is that code
bases can degrade over time.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/116-4
00:08:13.802 --> 00:08:15.084
They can basically.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/117-0
00:08:15.164 --> 00:08:18.934
Changes in technology.
The technology moves forward. It was,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/117-1
00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:22.086
you know,
at once it was a Greenfield project in a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/117-2
00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:25.239
particular technology using particular
techniques,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/117-3
00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:29.565
but now those that are old and no longer
considered state-of-the-art.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/117-4
00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:34.324
And so your code base is just by atrophy
has turned into a legacy code base.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/118-0
00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:40.241
The practices and standards for code
change tend to change over time as new

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/118-1
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:46.419
concepts are introduced and new new ways
of coding are are are and that can also

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/118-2
00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:52.444
affect the the quality of the code base
and again those practices will change.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/119-0
00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:56.161
Independently of the code.
This is not actually the code degrading

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/119-1
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.471
itself,
but it's just becoming out of date.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/119-2
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.095
The people that actually are working on
the code,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/119-3
00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:05.347
they come and go and they have different
techniques that they bring to the table

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/119-4
00:09:05.347 --> 00:09:08.444
and then so that can also degrade the
code base over time.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/120-0
00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:13.522
If they don't completely understand how
the original writers of the code intended

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/120-1
00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:17.727
for it to be to maintained,
business rules will change and make code

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/120-2
00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:21.871
obsolete. The workflows will change,
the architectures will change.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/120-3
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:25.650
These are all just different ways that
that code can degrade.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/120-4
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.844
And if we go back to that, you know.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/121-0
00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:32.925
List of 25 different ways that code can
be considered legacy. Those are all,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/121-1
00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:36.284
you know,
those are all ways they degrade over time.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-0
00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:43.849
So we mentioned Evergreen code.
Evergreen code is actually resist

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-1
00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:47.170
technical debt.
So that's one of the the the major ideas

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-2
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.200
here is that we don't want to incur
technical debt.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-3
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.686
We want to address technical debt at the
time that well and we don't want to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-4
00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:57.308
create it.
We want to we want to address the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/122-5
00:09:57.308 --> 00:09:58.764
technical issues as they.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/123-0
00:09:59.084 --> 00:10:04.728
They come up and not allow that to bog us
down and becomes and degrade the code

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/123-1
00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:08.678
early. Evergreen is not legacy,
but everything else is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/123-2
00:10:08.678 --> 00:10:14.463
And one way of thinking about it is if we
were to write this code all over again,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/123-3
00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:18.484
it would turn out pretty much just like
it is right now.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/124-0
00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:23.509
And as I mentioned,
very few code bases are maintained as

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/124-1
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:30.248
evergreen because it's very difficult to
do because you have all of those change

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/124-2
00:10:30.248 --> 00:10:36.987
factors that are affecting the code base
in causing it to become more legacy and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/124-3
00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:38.484
you have to fight.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/125-0
00:10:38.684 --> 00:10:44.723
All of them in order for you to be able
to maintain a code that's evergreen.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/125-1
00:10:44.723 --> 00:10:50.919
But I think AI assistance gives us a tool
that we need in order for us to move

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/125-2
00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:54.684
faster and address these technical debt
issues.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/126-0
00:10:55.164 --> 00:10:55.244
Um.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/127-0
00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:03.356
Right off the bat and keep the code
Evergreen as we go forward or move the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/127-1
00:11:03.356 --> 00:11:09.289
move a legacy code base more towards
Evergreen in an effective way and in a in

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/127-2
00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:14.846
a way that we've we you know we don't
neglect new features but we're just

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/127-3
00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:17.324
moving the code base back into a.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/128-0
00:11:17.404 --> 00:11:21.564
A place where it's easier to maintain.
Any questions on Evergreen?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/129-0
00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:29.632
Now we did a the exercise that the I a
bit of a confession to make in the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/129-1
00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:36.230
exercise yesterday where we ended up with
you know legacy code at the end of it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/129-2
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.244
I deliberately chose the the the GPT.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/130-0
00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:46.602
50 mini model I want as as as the model
because I I deliberately wanted to make

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/130-1
00:11:46.602 --> 00:11:53.970
sure that we ended up with something that
was not Evergreen if I go to that same

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/130-2
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.244
exercise with.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/131-0
00:11:55.524 --> 00:12:01.793
Claude Sonnet 5 or 451, sorry,
you'll get a lot closer to Evergreen

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/131-1
00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:08.153
Evergreen code using that model because
it's it has I think a better

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/131-2
00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:11.564
understanding of what a good code is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/132-0
00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:16.158
The code is good,
so that's just something to consider and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/132-1
00:12:16.158 --> 00:12:19.428
I'll talk a little bit later about,
you know,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/132-2
00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:25.258
the differences in the model and why some
models are better than other models for

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/132-3
00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:26.324
certain things.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/133-0
00:12:28.524 --> 00:12:32.699
But another point is that legacy code
should instill respect, not fear.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/133-1
00:12:32.699 --> 00:12:37.453
This is something I've always felt about
legacy code is that, you know, it works,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/133-2
00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:40.816
it's in production,
it's doing something valuable for the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/133-3
00:12:40.816 --> 00:12:43.425
business and therefore we should respect
it,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/133-4
00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:47.484
but we should not fear making changes to
it and trying to improve it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-0
00:12:47.564 --> 00:12:50.630
So you know it works. Don't break it.
You know it works.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-1
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.212
It's well tested typically by the users,
right?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-2
00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:57.085
I mean you can one assumption that you
can make for something that's in

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-3
00:12:57.085 --> 00:13:01.173
production and being used is that it,
you know there it may have still have

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-4
00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:04.346
some bugs in it,
but it is essentially well tested and you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/134-5
00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:04.884
can start.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-0
00:13:05.164 --> 00:13:07.870
Your regressor testing with that
assumption,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-1
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.379
and you can move faster by just creating
tests for the changes that you're

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-2
00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:15.325
introducing,
as opposed to having to worry about

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-3
00:13:15.325 --> 00:13:19.653
having regression testing for the entire
application. It is what it is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-4
00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:23.140
You get what you get and you don't throw
a fit, you know,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/135-5
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.004
going back to raising children.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/136-0
00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:30.720
And you know, you kind of have to take it,
take it for what it is and and then try

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/136-1
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.164
to do what you can to to improve it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/137-0
00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:37.044
Any questions on these concepts or?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/138-0
00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:39.364
Any thoughts on this?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/139-0
00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:43.355
Yeah,
I have a question just sort of about.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/139-1
00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:47.980
I'm not sure I like fully understand what
you mean by like.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/139-2
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.604
So when you say Evergreen code,
do you mean like this code?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/142-0
00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:58.472
Is so when you say green,
you mean like Greenfield, right?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/141-0
00:13:58.364 --> 00:13:59.924
Yes, right.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/142-1
00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:03.425
It's like it's new code.
So like Evergreen code is basically just

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/142-2
00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:08.453
like the practice of like continually
making sure that it's green.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/144-0
00:14:07.484 --> 00:14:11.557
Right, that's right, right.
And that's what it's referred to as

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/142-3
00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:09.804
Is that right? OK.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/143-0
00:14:10.084 --> 00:14:10.484
So bye.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/144-1
00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:14.802
Evergreen, right. And you know it takes,
it takes,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/144-2
00:14:14.802 --> 00:14:20.084
you know typically without ASI assistance,
I think it takes a lot of dedication to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/144-3
00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:24.284
keep it, to keep it green.
You have to have buy in for management

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/144-4
00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:27.084
that you're not going to take on
technical.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/145-0
00:14:27.164 --> 00:14:32.690
That if you find that you need to
implement something and you need to do

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/145-1
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.384
additional technology,
whether that be adding tests or adding

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/145-2
00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:43.364
monitoring or any of the things that
typically don't show up as features on a.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/146-0
00:14:43.804 --> 00:14:48.404
On a user screen that you're going to
take the time to do that implementation.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/149-0
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:53.664
OK, so like the I I guess in my mind,
like the idea is that like you don't,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/147-0
00:14:49.884 --> 00:14:51.204
Good.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/149-1
00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:57.308
you don't write Evergreen code,
you write green code and then you like

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/149-2
00:14:57.308 --> 00:15:00.182
keep it green.
And then that's sort of what you mean by

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/148-0
00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:01.604
That's right. That's correct.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/149-3
00:15:00.182 --> 00:15:03.004
like Evergreen code. OK, OK,
that makes sense. Thanks.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/150-0
00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:11.564
So let's just talk about some things
before we get into engaging with with

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/150-1
00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:14.636
copilot.
We want to have a strategy for backing

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/150-2
00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:19.756
out of changes, you know, branching,
tagging, you know, recording a a a commit,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/150-3
00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:24.812
archiving something, zipping something,
anything that will do allows you to go

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/150-4
00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:25.644
back because.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/151-0
00:15:25.964 --> 00:15:29.435
Because code generation is non
deterministic,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/151-1
00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:35.245
there's no guarantee that what you're
gonna get is something that's gonna be

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/151-2
00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:40.752
suitable for what you need to do,
and you may decide that it's no longer

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/151-3
00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:45.204
worth the effort to go down a particular
strategy or path.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/152-0
00:15:45.364 --> 00:15:52.103
You'll wanna go back and go back to a
previous iteration of it and try a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/152-1
00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:59.395
different technique or a different model
or a different way of approaching the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/152-2
00:15:59.395 --> 00:16:02.164
problem. I once had a copilot.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/153-0
00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:08.247
Dissay a little bit because I was trying
to drive towards a particular outcome and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/153-1
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:11.502
it kept suggesting a strategy that I
didn't,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/153-2
00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:17.360
I didn't really approve of and and so I
kept modifying the prompt and I kept not

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/153-3
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.844
getting what I want and I kept undoing it
and undoing it and.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/154-0
00:16:21.924 --> 00:16:26.013
And undoing it.
And then eventually Copilot comes back

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/154-1
00:16:26.013 --> 00:16:31.811
and says I've noticed that you've been,
you've not been accepting my changes.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/154-2
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:37.164
Perhaps I should try a different approach,
which I thought was amazing.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/156-0
00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:41.992
So have a strategy for testing that code.
No matter who or what wrote it,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/156-1
00:16:41.992 --> 00:16:46.582
you need to have confidence that your
test automation will catch the issues

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/156-2
00:16:46.582 --> 00:16:50.506
before it reach production.
So you know this is and there's many

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/156-3
00:16:50.506 --> 00:16:53.284
different techniques for for this one of
the.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/157-0
00:16:53.844 --> 00:17:00.093
Ones that I like is a feature flagging
and that allows you to essentially deploy

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/157-1
00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:05.801
code into production and test it in
production without actually having to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/157-2
00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:10.276
expose it to end users.
That's I think a really effective

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/157-3
00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:13.284
approach of moving a code base forward.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/158-0
00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:15.004
And not.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/159-0
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:20.231
And not actually exposing yourself to too
much risk,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/159-1
00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:26.099
but the idea is that you really need to
have solid tests in order for you to,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/159-2
00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:32.343
I think, engage with a legacy code base.
So that would be and David Feathers talks

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/159-3
00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:35.804
about this in his book that that's
something.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/160-0
00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:38.727
The first thing that you need to do and
and that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/160-1
00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:43.074
But basically what that allows you to do
is to feel confident that if you make a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/160-2
00:17:43.074 --> 00:17:45.918
change that you can you you stop.
You don't have to.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/160-3
00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:49.942
If you don't have that confidence,
you have to stop and and build it first

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/160-4
00:17:49.942 --> 00:17:53.484
because you want to make sure that you
have that that confidence.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/161-0
00:17:53.684 --> 00:18:00.062
One of the techniques that I've seen used
very effectively for adding tests to to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/161-1
00:18:00.062 --> 00:18:04.495
the legacy code.
It's something that was called approval

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/161-2
00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:08.540
test, but now it's called.
I forget the name of it,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/161-3
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.284
but the idea is it's a simple test
framework that says that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/162-0
00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:17.485
You know,
if you're looking at a particular output

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/162-1
00:18:17.485 --> 00:18:21.823
of of a method,
you can save the entire contents of that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/162-2
00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:27.911
output as a test and then just validate
that the code continues to produce that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/162-3
00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:28.444
output.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/163-0
00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:33.995
You don't don't need to specify
individually every single property or

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/163-1
00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:37.864
field's value.
You just you just just make the assertion

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/163-2
00:18:37.864 --> 00:18:43.090
that the entire the entire output is
correct and then that will allow you to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/163-3
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.484
create a simple test.
You can do it very quickly.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/164-0
00:18:46.884 --> 00:18:51.375
And Llewellyn Falco did a demonstration
where he had a timer that would go off

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/164-1
00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:56.093
every two minutes and he would commit the
code changes with test passing as he was

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/164-2
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:59.106
going through and doing the legacy code
refactoring.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/164-3
00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:03.654
It was a really effective technique in
the sense that you could create the test

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/164-4
00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:06.724
very quickly,
you could then verify that you haven't.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/165-0
00:19:06.844 --> 00:19:12.257
Broken anything as you're doing a
refactoring very efficiently and move

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/165-1
00:19:12.257 --> 00:19:16.016
forward.
So that's a technique that I've found to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/165-2
00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:21.504
be very useful is using a testing
frameworks that don't require a lot of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/165-3
00:19:21.504 --> 00:19:23.684
effort in order to implement.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/166-0
00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:26.932
You know,
AI can can take a lot of that place.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/166-1
00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:31.112
It doesn't, you know,
AI doesn't care how many properties you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/166-2
00:19:31.112 --> 00:19:35.965
have to test in order to to assert that
something is working correctly.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/166-3
00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:40.684
So that can that can be another way of
approaching that same problem.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/167-0
00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:44.364
And then you need a strategy for
reviewing those changes.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/168-0
00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:51.241
You know the the thing that that that it
will strike you early on is that you are

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/168-1
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:56.414
generating a lot of code and now you have
a lot of code to review and you need a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/168-2
00:19:56.414 --> 00:20:01.204
plan to be able to do that effectively
and that plan may include using AI.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/169-0
00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:09.174
To actually do a do an initial code
review and you can have a part of your

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/169-1
00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:16.644
your PR hygiene that it must it must pass
an AI code review before it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/170-0
00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:21.343
Before you pass it on to a developer to
actually review it,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/170-1
00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:26.659
and that can be effective if we do it,
if we implement the the context correctly

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/170-2
00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:30.204
so that the AI reviewer knows what to
what to expect.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/171-0
00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:35.114
And then you want to keep your change
sets as small as possible.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/171-1
00:20:35.114 --> 00:20:39.153
I I mentioned this yesterday.
Don't make those changes incremental as

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/171-2
00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:42.037
you saw,
you know you can easily build up a large

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/171-3
00:20:42.037 --> 00:20:46.364
number of changes very quickly if you if
you don't keep stay on top of it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/172-0
00:20:46.564 --> 00:20:50.004
Any any comments or questions here?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/173-0
00:20:51.204 --> 00:20:55.805
I have a question about the AI code
review. What does that look like?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/173-1
00:20:55.805 --> 00:21:00.932
Is it copilot reviewing copilot generated
code or some other AI reviewing the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/173-2
00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:02.444
copilot generated code?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/175-0
00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:08.230
It's usually copilot generate reviewing,
you know, copilot generated code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/175-1
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.348
You can kind of mitigate for that by
choosing a different model.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/174-0
00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:11.284
And.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/175-2
00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:19.884
You could say I wrote the code in Cloud 4.
5 but I want to review it with ChatGPT.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/176-0
00:21:20.164 --> 00:21:22.604
ChatGPT file file.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/177-0
00:21:21.044 --> 00:21:27.724
And how how exactly do you implement this
to make it automatic in a pull request?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/178-0
00:21:28.324 --> 00:21:32.333
Well,
what you would do is you basically there

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/178-1
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:39.071
there's a, there's a CLI for copilot,
so you can use the CLI to actually run a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/178-2
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:45.724
a prompt that contains an instruction
that it should use a particular bottle.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/180-0
00:21:46.164 --> 00:21:49.768
And then that will cause that to to
produce that model.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/180-1
00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:54.788
Then you could have the AI review the
review to make sure there's nothing out

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/180-2
00:21:54.788 --> 00:21:59.744
of or have the since they have the review
produce a thumbs up or thumbs down

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/180-3
00:21:59.744 --> 00:22:03.284
message that would then allow the
pipeline to proceed.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/179-0
00:22:00.364 --> 00:22:00.444
Is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/182-0
00:22:02.484 --> 00:22:08.284
Is is this something you are going to
demonstrate today or another day?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/183-0
00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:10.804
No, we can look at it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/184-0
00:22:12.604 --> 00:22:16.721
It's not something I've I've implemented
up to this point, but anyway,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/184-1
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:21.244
now that I have a PRS working in our repo,
we can take a shot at trying to do

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/184-2
00:22:21.244 --> 00:22:22.404
something like that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/186-0
00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:25.693
Yeah,
I would be really curious to see how how

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/186-1
00:22:25.693 --> 00:22:29.219
effective that is and what it looks like.
You know, is it?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/185-0
00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:28.964
Sure, sure.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/186-2
00:22:29.219 --> 00:22:32.804
Is it like a PR decoration with comments
or something more?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/188-0
00:22:33.844 --> 00:22:38.033
Sure. Yeah,
we'll take a look at maybe maybe tomorrow

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/187-0
00:22:35.404 --> 00:22:35.524
OK.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/188-1
00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:38.964
or Thursday.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/189-0
00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:40.844
OK. Thanks.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/190-0
00:22:42.044 --> 00:22:42.284
Sure.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/191-0
00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:48.856
OK, so moving on then.
One thing I'd like to to to emphasize I

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/191-1
00:22:48.856 --> 00:22:55.628
think is that we want to treat copilot as
a highly skilled junior developer who

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/191-2
00:22:55.628 --> 00:22:58.844
needs effective management, right? So.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/192-0
00:22:59.484 --> 00:23:03.918
You know, copilot can do, you know,
do quite a lot of things. In fact,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/192-1
00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:08.413
many times it it'll it'll try and
introduce techniques that I wouldn't.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/192-2
00:23:08.413 --> 00:23:13.346
I'm not really aware of and I have to
actually educate myself on its output in

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/192-3
00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:15.844
order for me to understand what it does.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/193-0
00:23:16.644 --> 00:23:23.188
But it's still in a sense constrained by
the context that it's been given and its

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/193-1
00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:26.779
ability to produce output,
because remember,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/193-2
00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:32.524
it doesn't really understand the code in
in the same way that we do so.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/194-0
00:23:32.804 --> 00:23:38.926
It so it understands that at a much lower
level and the code that it's generating

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/194-1
00:23:38.926 --> 00:23:42.808
is just is.
It's a prediction of what it thinks you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/194-2
00:23:42.808 --> 00:23:46.839
you're expecting,
but it's no guarantee that it will.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/194-3
00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:47.884
So we need to.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/195-0
00:23:48.004 --> 00:23:52.969
We need to both provide it with clear and
direct instructions on what it what we're

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/195-1
00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:57.403
expecting and we saw some of that
yesterday I think in our in our exercise

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/195-2
00:23:57.403 --> 00:24:02.309
where we would ask for something but not
get not get it back close to what we need

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/195-3
00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:06.978
and have to modify our prompts or change
our our our approach to get something

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/195-4
00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:07.924
that was closer.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/196-0
00:24:08.084 --> 00:24:11.976
And you know the the formula where you
know clear instructions and careful

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/196-1
00:24:11.976 --> 00:24:13.844
review will give us better outcomes.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/197-0
00:24:15.724 --> 00:24:21.391
So context is really important in in this
aspect in that if it's not in the context,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/197-1
00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:26.657
it's not the A I doesn't know about it
and doesn't, it can't, it can't use it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/197-2
00:24:26.657 --> 00:24:31.191
So there's two aspects to it.
There's having too little context and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/197-3
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:32.924
then it's having too much.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/198-0
00:24:33.524 --> 00:24:37.818
Too little contents context means that
the A I is open to doing the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/198-1
00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:42.932
implementation in any way that it sees
fit or any way that it thinks it might be

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/198-2
00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:47.731
the most appropriate solution that may
not coincide coincide with what your

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/198-3
00:24:47.731 --> 00:24:48.804
expectations are.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/199-0
00:24:50.244 --> 00:24:56.004
And too much is that you've got so much
context that the IT can't hold the the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/199-1
00:24:56.004 --> 00:25:01.326
entire context in its token window and
then something and then it has to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/199-2
00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:06.867
basically get rid of some context in
order for it to be able to process and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/199-3
00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:09.564
you don't have control about what it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/200-0
00:25:09.804 --> 00:25:14.522
Decides to get rid of.
So I'll talk a little bit about how we

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/200-1
00:25:14.522 --> 00:25:20.078
can manage that and some techniques that
we have for understanding that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/200-2
00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:24.948
But that whole process is getting better
in two different ways.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/200-3
00:25:24.948 --> 00:25:27.764
One is that the tooling is improving.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/201-0
00:25:28.004 --> 00:25:34.324
There's a enhancement question and we
might even see something next week on

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/201-1
00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:41.225
this in that we're expecting that copilot
will be able to give us more information

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/201-2
00:25:41.225 --> 00:25:44.884
about how we're utilizing that context
and.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/203-0
00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:51.581
Whether and helping us know when we've
got too much context and therefore we can

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/203-1
00:25:51.581 --> 00:25:55.906
start working on paring that down.
And the other thing is,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/203-2
00:25:55.906 --> 00:26:00.964
is that the as the AI models improve,
they increase the size of the.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/204-0
00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:08.204
The token window and therefore you can,
you know, put more context into it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/204-1
00:26:08.204 --> 00:26:12.704
In fact,
one of the reasons that Claude saw it is

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/204-2
00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:16.484
favored for large scale AI implementation.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/205-0
00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:23.607
Code generation is that it has a larger
context window than ChatGPT 5 or many

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/205-1
00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:28.262
other models,
and we'll talk a bit more about that in a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/205-2
00:26:28.262 --> 00:26:32.168
second.
You can manage context with prompts by

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/205-3
00:26:32.168 --> 00:26:36.324
crafting effective prompts and using good
prompt.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/206-0
00:26:36.604 --> 00:26:40.191
Engineering techniques.
You can minimize the amount of context

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/206-1
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:44.688
that you're providing and having the
models focus on only the context that you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/206-2
00:26:44.688 --> 00:26:49.015
think is the most important for that task,
and we'll talk a bit about that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/206-3
00:26:49.015 --> 00:26:51.804
We'll show some examples and build some
prompts.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/207-0
00:26:51.964 --> 00:26:56.294
For to that effort. But you know,
the thing about the context is right now

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/207-1
00:26:56.294 --> 00:26:59.355
it's pretty opaque. It's it's kind of hit,
you know,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/207-2
00:26:59.355 --> 00:27:03.974
you're kind of guessing and you're kind
of you don't have any precise tools for

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/207-3
00:27:03.974 --> 00:27:07.900
measuring the entire context.
But I'll show you some techniques for

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/207-4
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.364
actually getting a sense,
at least a sense of what it what.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/208-0
00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:15.799
What your context looks like.
You can add add context with you know

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/208-1
00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:20.033
instructions and markdown instruction
files. We'll go through that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/208-2
00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:23.708
Those are very useful.
So those are things like file based

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/208-3
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:27.444
custom instructions which does automatic
context injection.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/209-0
00:27:28.364 --> 00:27:33.670
Instruction scopes the the structure and
authoring of best practices and structure

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/209-1
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.059
and author structuring and authoring best
practices.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/209-2
00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:42.109
Again the chat modes and then chat modes
are also effective in that sense that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/209-3
00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:43.004
they are like.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/210-0
00:27:43.244 --> 00:27:48.806
They're like prompts that are workflows
and focused on accomplishing a particular

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/210-1
00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:51.995
task, and you can,
in those custom chat modes,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/210-2
00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:57.557
specify what what additional things that
you want to bring into your context when

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/210-3
00:27:57.557 --> 00:27:59.524
you're actually in that mode.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/211-0
00:27:59.884 --> 00:28:03.581
And what that allows you to do is to say,
OK,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/211-1
00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:08.563
I have all of these different
instructions with some of these

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/211-2
00:28:08.563 --> 00:28:12.903
instructions.
Since instruction files are essentially

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/211-3
00:28:12.903 --> 00:28:17.644
global in scope,
they basically can you can be you can be.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/212-0
00:28:18.244 --> 00:28:23.521
Filling up your context with instructions
that are not applicable to the task at

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/212-1
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:26.192
hand.
The custom chat modes allow you to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/212-2
00:28:26.192 --> 00:28:30.296
specify specifically what context that
you do want to include,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/212-3
00:28:30.296 --> 00:28:34.204
and then you can take on a persona of a
particular type of.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/213-0
00:28:34.484 --> 00:28:41.108
Change agent like a like a tester or an
architect or a reviewer or some other

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/213-1
00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:47.561
persona and then this will allows you to
focus the AI on only that specific

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/213-2
00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:49.684
context and it helps you.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/214-0
00:28:50.164 --> 00:28:53.684
Keep your context a little bit more under
control.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/215-0
00:28:57.324 --> 00:29:02.407
So in terms of awareness of context,
Copilot has a limited context window.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/215-1
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:07.016
It's called a token budget.
But each each A I has a different token

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/215-2
00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:12.234
budget and as I mentioned and I'll go,
there's a slide coming up about that,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/215-3
00:29:12.234 --> 00:29:15.284
about how big these are on different
models.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/216-0
00:29:15.564 --> 00:29:19.999
So long prompt files can push the useful
information out of scope.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/216-1
00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:25.029
So we This is why we want to try to
manage context and and premium uses can

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/216-2
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:30.457
be tracked with the the multi dashboard,
but that's a slightly different sense of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/216-3
00:29:30.457 --> 00:29:32.244
context in the in terms of.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/217-0
00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:38.439
You can essentially if you run out of
premium usage tokens, it will.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/217-1
00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:44.811
You'll effectively either have to pay for
them or you cannot use those models until

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/217-2
00:29:44.811 --> 00:29:46.404
the end of the month.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/218-0
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:52.294
So in terms of prompt design,
you want to keep your prompts as shorter

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/218-1
00:29:52.294 --> 00:29:55.851
and modular as you can use step-by-step
requests,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/218-2
00:29:55.851 --> 00:30:00.830
reuse prompt files and templates,
and reset the chat if you feel like

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/218-3
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.324
you're having issues.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/219-0
00:30:02.524 --> 00:30:07.102
Your answer's drifting and it's not.
If you've noticed that, for example,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/219-1
00:30:07.102 --> 00:30:11.804
the prompt response is slowing down,
you can just go up and clear the chat.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/219-2
00:30:11.804 --> 00:30:16.630
The issue with that is that it's not
specifying what context you're gonna get

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/219-3
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.599
rid of.
You're just getting all the context and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/219-4
00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:21.084
now you have to come up.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/220-0
00:30:22.124 --> 00:30:28.952
Up with the strategy for rebuilding that
context and and prompt files can help you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/220-1
00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:33.313
with that.
Chat modes can help you with that and and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/220-2
00:30:33.313 --> 00:30:38.084
so and we'll talk about some of those
things as well, so.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/221-0
00:30:38.404 --> 00:30:44.976
And also talk about how do we save
context and basically resume that context

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/221-1
00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:51.718
either at a later date or on a different
machine or just you want to clear out

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/221-2
00:30:51.718 --> 00:30:58.204
your context and reestablish it in order
to make things to reduce the size.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/222-0
00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:01.953
The the context window and to get
everything working again you can.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/222-1
00:31:01.953 --> 00:31:06.364
There are techniques that you can use
that can accomplish and help you do that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/223-0
00:31:08.364 --> 00:31:13.476
And so in terms of management,
you can use those hashtag mentioned to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/223-1
00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:16.835
pull in specific files or folders or
symbols.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/223-2
00:31:16.835 --> 00:31:22.458
This is our something that we can do in
chat modes and in prompt files to to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/223-3
00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:24.284
restrict context you can.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/224-0
00:31:24.364 --> 00:31:30.426
There's a feature called Spaces.
I haven't really worked with a copilot

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/224-1
00:31:30.426 --> 00:31:34.215
since I'm primarily working alone on
things,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/224-2
00:31:34.215 --> 00:31:40.697
but you can actually go into into the
copilot UI and you can then specify in

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/224-3
00:31:40.697 --> 00:31:43.644
the UI instruction files and other.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/225-0
00:31:44.244 --> 00:31:51.031
Documents for to define a context and
then go into the chat window in the IDE

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/225-1
00:31:51.031 --> 00:31:57.905
and then go use the the GitHub tool to
actually recall that space and use that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/225-2
00:31:57.905 --> 00:32:02.604
that context in your current chat window,
which is a.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/226-0
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:08.129
An interesting way that you could share
essentially A context between multiple

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/226-1
00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:12.574
developers so that each one of them is
not rebuilding that context.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/226-2
00:32:12.574 --> 00:32:17.738
But there's two limitations to that,
or at least one limitation that's I think

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/226-3
00:32:17.738 --> 00:32:20.484
makes it a little a little useful is that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/227-0
00:32:20.684 --> 00:32:26.965
While in the spaces you can use it to,
you can add a repository into that space

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/227-1
00:32:26.965 --> 00:32:31.833
and include that context.
When you reference that in the IDE,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/227-2
00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:35.444
that repository is no longer in that
context.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/228-0
00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:40.977
And but you're in so you could use in
addition to that like like the code base

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/228-1
00:32:40.977 --> 00:32:45.168
tag to include the context of what you're
currently working on.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/228-2
00:32:45.168 --> 00:32:50.144
But what I would but in my my mind it's
like you know just by defining them

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/228-3
00:32:50.144 --> 00:32:55.120
within the project and saving them with
the project itself inside of GitHub

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/228-4
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.644
Copiler.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/229-0
00:32:55.724 --> 00:33:02.179
Essentially they can accomplish the same
thing and then this is what it's easy to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/229-1
00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:08.633
do is that essentially your contact is it
infers from the files that you actually

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/229-2
00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:15.324
have open and you can by just keeping the
number of tabs you have open in the IE to.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/230-0
00:33:15.564 --> 00:33:21.698
As few as possible can reduce the noise
that can can clutter up your context.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/230-1
00:33:21.698 --> 00:33:24.844
So any questions so far on this context?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/234-0
00:33:27.324 --> 00:33:32.489
Not on the context,
but what is the GitHub copilot UI?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/231-0
00:33:28.324 --> 00:33:28.444
The.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/234-1
00:33:32.489 --> 00:33:38.124
Can you give us? Oh, oh,
that's what you meant. OK, thanks.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/232-0
00:33:32.924 --> 00:33:35.684
That's the github.com. It's github.com.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/233-0
00:33:37.084 --> 00:33:38.724
Yeah, yeah.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/235-0
00:33:40.044 --> 00:33:43.733
All right,
so just a couple of ways of dealing with

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/235-1
00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:46.855
it.
Premium request dashboard for the usage

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/235-2
00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:50.403
tokens.
We showed you that and talked about that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/235-3
00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:56.149
You keep an eye on on your usage tokens
and token estimation tools like the open

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/235-4
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:59.484
AI tokenizer. If you search for that,
you can.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/236-0
00:33:59.884 --> 00:34:05.515
You can basically give it a a file and it
will tell you how many tokens that it

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/236-1
00:34:05.515 --> 00:34:10.793
would need or produced to to load that
file, which is a a interesting way.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/236-2
00:34:10.793 --> 00:34:16.705
And there's a watch for off topic replies.
That could be a sign that it's that your

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/236-3
00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:18.324
context is overflowing.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/237-0
00:34:18.924 --> 00:34:22.374
It'll be nice.
It'll be nice if the next week they they

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/237-1
00:34:22.374 --> 00:34:27.179
they announced that there there's more
tools for managing context coming into

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/237-2
00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:32.230
copilot because that's something that is
I I think a a really useful feature that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/237-3
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.524
would be nice to see.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/238-0
00:34:34.204 --> 00:34:40.543
I did some work with this yesterday after
class and and I have a a a Python a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/238-1
00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:46.801
little bit of Python code to show you
that takes takes advantage of a Python

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/238-2
00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:52.084
library that can do some context analysis
and tell you how many.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/239-0
00:34:52.444 --> 00:34:52.924
How much?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/240-0
00:34:54.804 --> 00:35:00.465
How much context you you're you're
currently using using a rough estimate.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/240-1
00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:04.088
It's not, it's not,
it's not entirely accurate,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/240-2
00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:10.051
but it gives you a rough estimation.
So we talked about this coming soon would

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/240-3
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:12.164
be real-time token counters.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/241-0
00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:17.027
And contents usage indicators would be
very nice.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/241-1
00:35:17.027 --> 00:35:23.552
So here's a slide that just talks about
did a couple of different models here

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/241-2
00:35:23.552 --> 00:35:30.244
that and how how many tokens they how
they they provide in their token windows.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/242-0
00:35:30.524 --> 00:35:35.959
So Cloud Sonnet 4.5 you know 200,
000 plus you know they don't publish

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/242-1
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:40.552
exactly how many how side what the size
of their window is,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/242-2
00:35:40.552 --> 00:35:45.604
but it's it can it's it's considered to
be over the over 200,000.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/243-0
00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:50.341
200,000 chat to GB5 is 128,
000 for input and 16,000 for output.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/243-1
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:55.906
So the idea between the difference this
is what you're providing in terms of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/243-2
00:35:55.906 --> 00:35:59.519
context.
This is the number of tokens that it can

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/243-3
00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:00.964
use to produce code.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/245-0
00:36:01.564 --> 00:36:07.504
Then Chat TB40 was 64K.
So if you can see here in the progression

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/245-1
00:36:07.504 --> 00:36:14.704
just in one iteration it's doubled the
number of tokens and the benefit of Chat

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/245-2
00:36:14.704 --> 00:36:19.924
TBT 40 and five is that they are tuned
for IEE workflows.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/246-0
00:36:20.284 --> 00:36:25.315
So there there are there's some, you know,
some benefits for using Tacky B55,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/246-1
00:36:25.315 --> 00:36:30.218
even though it has a smaller window,
it's better at step-by-step operations

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/246-2
00:36:30.218 --> 00:36:34.281
and things like that.
Where cloud son it is better for all you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/246-3
00:36:34.281 --> 00:36:39.248
know when you have big context and you
want to be able to do a lot with that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/246-4
00:36:39.248 --> 00:36:39.764
context.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/247-0
00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:43.704
And the basic,
it's a the trade off is basically the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/247-1
00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:46.879
size of your content versus reasoning
style.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/247-2
00:36:46.879 --> 00:36:51.324
So you know each of them have their own
particular approaches.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/248-0
00:36:52.524 --> 00:36:54.204
Uh, any questions on this?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/249-0
00:36:55.604 --> 00:36:58.604
All right, let's talk about. Oh, go ahead.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/250-0
00:36:55.964 --> 00:37:01.009
If I I have a quick question,
if you give it some free text context and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/250-1
00:37:01.009 --> 00:37:06.684
there is a word that repeats 25 times,
is that 25 tokens or just a single token?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/253-0
00:37:08.724 --> 00:37:12.215
Yeah, I'm going.
I don't know for sure on that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/253-1
00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:18.106
My guess is that it's the single token
and it may break that that word down into

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/253-2
00:37:18.106 --> 00:37:23.924
multiple tokens, right? It's tokens.
It's not one to one correspondence, right?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/251-0
00:37:19.684 --> 00:37:19.804
OK.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/252-0
00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:25.364
OK. Thanks.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/254-0
00:37:29.124 --> 00:37:32.945
So MCP servers,
so these are they've only come out you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/254-1
00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:37.530
know earlier in the year.
This is something that Egenics proposed

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/254-2
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:43.158
and implemented and all of the other and
there's been a lot of adoption on this.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/254-3
00:37:43.158 --> 00:37:46.284
This is part of the the move towards
Egenic.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/255-0
00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:52.242
Agenic models and being able to actually
do things with it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/255-1
00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:59.819
And what this MCP server and tools do is
they provide you with the ability to do a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/255-2
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:02.284
lot more functional things.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/256-0
00:38:03.124 --> 00:38:08.667
Inside of the when using the chat model.
So the idea when when these first models

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/256-1
00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:12.182
came out,
the only thing that you could do was ask.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/256-2
00:38:12.182 --> 00:38:17.725
So if you you asked you know can you can
you create a a method that would do this

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/256-3
00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:18.604
and it would.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/257-0
00:38:18.804 --> 00:38:23.473
Output that method into the chat window
and if the ID was sophisticated enough,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/257-1
00:38:23.473 --> 00:38:28.258
you could actually say insert that piece
of code into your code base and it would

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/257-2
00:38:28.258 --> 00:38:31.001
move it over into your code.
Then we get into.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/257-3
00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:35.611
Then we got the feature to do edits and
then that would allow us to to do this

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/257-4
00:38:35.611 --> 00:38:38.004
essentially automatic insertion in which.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/258-0
00:38:38.364 --> 00:38:44.558
And the other benefit of that is that it
could tell you what code was removed and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/258-1
00:38:44.558 --> 00:38:48.334
what code was added and that was a great
feature.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/258-2
00:38:48.334 --> 00:38:53.244
And then now they've come up with
basically the idea of Agentec.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/259-0
00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:57.496
We're having agents and this agents have
agency to do that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/259-1
00:38:57.496 --> 00:39:02.607
We saw quite a bit of that yesterday
where we were granting it permissions to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/259-2
00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:07.783
to tools in order for it to do certain
operations so that we would not have to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/259-3
00:39:07.783 --> 00:39:12.829
continually approve those operations.
So you know for for read only commands

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/259-4
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:13.484
there's a.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/260-0
00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:20.645
There's an option that you can put in
your your visual code settings that would

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/260-1
00:39:20.645 --> 00:39:27.461
indicate that all read operations are
permitted and then you can cherry pick

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/260-2
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:31.444
the right operations that you want to
allow.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/261-0
00:39:32.404 --> 00:39:38.388
And that can make it working energetic
mode much much easier in in a sense that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/261-1
00:39:38.388 --> 00:39:42.128
it will take take on more of the work on
its own,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/261-2
00:39:42.128 --> 00:39:47.364
do more of the the execution and then
only stop to ask for direction.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/262-0
00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:53.022
Or approval when it encounters a command
that you haven't given an explicit

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/262-1
00:39:53.022 --> 00:39:56.935
permission to run.
So what you then has are MCP servers,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/262-2
00:39:56.935 --> 00:40:02.495
and it's always a good idea to try to
keep up on what new servers are available,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/262-3
00:40:02.495 --> 00:40:07.644
particularly in your problem space.
So there are things that can help you.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/263-0
00:40:07.644 --> 00:40:13.004
You improve your coding experience.
You can often find an MCP server that can

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/263-1
00:40:13.004 --> 00:40:18.365
help you with doing that. For example,
this one is referring to the Microsoft

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/263-2
00:40:18.365 --> 00:40:21.595
Docs.
There's an MCP server for Microsoft Docs

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/263-3
00:40:21.595 --> 00:40:25.924
and that would allow you to do searches
of the Microsoft Docs.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/264-0
00:40:26.644 --> 00:40:32.732
For information and the main benefit of
something like that is it keeps you from

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/264-1
00:40:32.732 --> 00:40:37.542
having to leave the IDE.
You can stay within Visual Studio Code

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/264-2
00:40:37.542 --> 00:40:43.254
and you can do all of your lookups in
Microsoft Docs and use it to help you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/264-3
00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:45.884
write your code and then those MCC.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-0
00:40:45.964 --> 00:40:48.913
TCP servers then expose different kinds
of tools.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-1
00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:53.218
So you see here that three different
tools are outlined in this diagram.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-2
00:40:53.218 --> 00:40:57.170
One is to search the documentation,
one is to fetch a full page of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-3
00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.414
documentation,
and one is to search for code examples.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-4
00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:04.955
So you can specifically say search the
Microsoft docs for a code sample on a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/265-5
00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:05.604
particular.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/266-0
00:41:06.244 --> 00:41:10.444
Or technique and it will return that for
you.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/267-0
00:41:12.444 --> 00:41:16.259
Questions on MCP.
We kind of went over that which was I had

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/267-1
00:41:16.259 --> 00:41:19.502
installed.
One of the things to be aware of is the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/267-2
00:41:19.502 --> 00:41:24.334
number of tools that you install is that
there is actually a limit on that,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/267-3
00:41:24.334 --> 00:41:28.212
and if you exceed that limit,
you'll see an icon in the IDE.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/267-4
00:41:28.212 --> 00:41:29.484
Let me see if I can.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/268-0
00:41:30.164 --> 00:41:35.525
Point down here, this tool icon,
you'll get a little warning symbol in it

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/268-1
00:41:35.525 --> 00:41:40.451
when you start to exceed that.
You can see here that I've currently

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/268-2
00:41:40.451 --> 00:41:45.015
selected the tools. In fact,
if I go down and select this one,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/268-3
00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:49.724
which is the Azure one,
you can see that it jumps up from 52 to.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/269-0
00:41:49.764 --> 00:41:55.004
So adding quite a bit of different 112.
Let me just.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/270-0
00:41:56.044 --> 00:42:01.414
This should we need to do one more.
Now it tells me I've that I have 130

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/270-1
00:42:01.414 --> 00:42:06.857
enabled and and an experience may be
degraded from calling more than what

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/270-2
00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:10.535
those 80s.
So that's something to keep in mind of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/270-3
00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:13.404
mind up because you that's essentially.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/271-0
00:42:14.004 --> 00:42:18.404
Stealing from your contact window.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/272-0
00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:26.884
That's what I wanted. I wanted BARP,
Python, no SQL Server, no Azure.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/273-0
00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:32.324
And no highlands back to my 52.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/274-0
00:42:35.164 --> 00:42:39.284
Any questions on MCP servers and tools?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/275-0
00:42:40.604 --> 00:42:47.058
And this is a the specification for this
is open so you can you can you can use

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/275-1
00:42:47.058 --> 00:42:53.673
copilot to help you create an MCP server
and deploy that and use that within your

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/275-2
00:42:53.673 --> 00:42:59.884
IDE if you have a specific need where you
do you have some sort of internal.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/276-0
00:43:00.404 --> 00:43:02.967
Resource that you want to be able to
access,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/276-1
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:06.156
but you can't do that directly through
the chat window.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/276-2
00:43:06.156 --> 00:43:10.713
You can actually run an MCP server to do
that for you and allow you to retrieve

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/276-3
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:15.440
information from some back end service or
system that you would like to be able to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/276-4
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.604
incorporate into your code generation.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/277-0
00:43:22.444 --> 00:43:23.844
All right, so um.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/278-0
00:43:25.164 --> 00:43:30.335
Any questions? All right,
so I I I showed you the QQ manual we

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/278-1
00:43:30.335 --> 00:43:36.984
talked to yesterday about built in and
not built any custom ones and then I just

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/278-2
00:43:36.984 --> 00:43:39.364
mentioned the 128 tool limit.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/279-0
00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:44.182
So let's move on and talk about
instruction files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/279-1
00:43:44.182 --> 00:43:49.909
So this is the 1st place where we can
start to add add a substantial amount of

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/279-2
00:43:49.909 --> 00:43:55.637
context and and allow that preserve that
context across all of our prompts and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/279-3
00:43:55.637 --> 00:43:57.884
since instruction files can be.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/280-0
00:43:59.524 --> 00:44:00.484
Uh um.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/281-0
00:44:02.084 --> 00:44:05.799
Get committed into source control.
That means that when you pull you when

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/281-1
00:44:05.799 --> 00:44:09.764
you change an instruction file the next
time another developer pulls that from

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/281-2
00:44:09.764 --> 00:44:12.325
that repo,
those instruction files will be updated

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/281-3
00:44:12.325 --> 00:44:16.240
and and it can be used and and will be
used for prompts going forward in that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/281-4
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.244
project. So this is.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/282-0
00:44:17.564 --> 00:44:24.663
Really effective way of of providing a
great deal of context to to to copilot

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/282-1
00:44:24.663 --> 00:44:31.488
and it is it's a great tool for for
controlling what the output looks like

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/282-2
00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:37.404
because you're giving very, very specific,
very context related.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/283-0
00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:42.267
Instructions so that you can do things
like project specific instructions where

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/283-1
00:44:42.267 --> 00:44:45.376
you describe what the project actually
consists of.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/283-2
00:44:45.376 --> 00:44:50.039
You can do text specific instructions,
which means that whenever you're using

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/283-3
00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:54.164
this particular technology,
I want you to follow these instructions.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/284-0
00:44:54.604 --> 00:44:58.993
Things like standards and practices,
like what your coding standards are.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/284-1
00:44:58.993 --> 00:45:03.383
If you have a specific way that you want
to write code as a organization,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/284-2
00:45:03.383 --> 00:45:08.247
you can you can encapsulate those into a
into an instruction file and then the AI

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/284-3
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:10.204
will use these instruction files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/285-0
00:45:11.724 --> 00:45:17.968
When it's preparing output for you and it
will help you maintain consistency within

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/285-1
00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:22.948
your code base. But you have to.
One caveat is that you need to be

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/285-2
00:45:22.948 --> 00:45:27.631
consistent with how they're implemented
and not contradictory,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/285-3
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:31.124
and I'll show you a technique for
determining.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/286-0
00:45:31.564 --> 00:45:38.841
Whether or not your your instruction
files are consistent and which is a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/286-1
00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:44.324
really effective way of of managing
instruction files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/287-0
00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:52.120
All right, so let's talk about locations.
So there is a a personal file which is in

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/287-1
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.716
your home directory in in a GitHub folder.
In your home directory you can put a a a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/287-2
00:45:57.716 --> 00:46:02.979
a copilot instruction file there and
provide instruction files that only apply

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/287-3
00:46:02.979 --> 00:46:05.644
to you. The benefit of the the personal.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/288-0
00:46:05.684 --> 00:46:11.129
Instruction files is that it applies to
all projects on your machine or that you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/288-1
00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:14.153
have this personal instruction file
located.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/288-2
00:46:14.153 --> 00:46:19.531
So I tend to use this for things that are
specific to the way I like Copilot to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/288-3
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:22.959
operate,
though it may not be something that needs

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/288-4
00:46:22.959 --> 00:46:25.244
to be shared among the whole team.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/289-0
00:46:25.404 --> 00:46:33.799
But you know it's it's it's useful for
setting up how you want it to reply.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/289-1
00:46:33.799 --> 00:46:42.525
Yesterday you were asking about how to
control the output in terms of how much

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/289-2
00:46:42.525 --> 00:46:44.844
verbage it gives you.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/291-0
00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:51.170
A personal you could set up instructions
for that in our personal instruction file.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/291-1
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:56.855
That way you could say I just give me
very very terse responses and don't give

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/291-2
00:46:56.855 --> 00:47:01.965
you and don't give me a lot of
explanation and it will then reduce the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/291-3
00:47:01.965 --> 00:47:04.124
amount of output it gives you.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/292-0
00:47:04.804 --> 00:47:08.641
Specifically that,
and that might be that might be a good

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/292-1
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:13.867
use of the copilot instruction file,
because you may want other people may not

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/292-2
00:47:13.867 --> 00:47:16.844
want that same instruction to be to be
used.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/293-0
00:47:18.164 --> 00:47:21.828
When you're dealing with a project level
instructions,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/293-1
00:47:21.828 --> 00:47:26.825
these as I mentioned are committed into
git. They go into a GitHub folder,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/293-2
00:47:26.825 --> 00:47:30.622
typically put them in an instructions
folder under that,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/293-3
00:47:30.622 --> 00:47:35.952
and then I've also used a folder under
the instruction folder called generated,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/293-4
00:47:35.952 --> 00:47:38.084
which I I put instruction files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/294-0
00:47:38.164 --> 00:47:46.115
That are generated by Copilot in
comparison to instruction files that I've

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/294-1
00:47:46.115 --> 00:47:52.688
created personally,
and you should include like a suffix here

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/294-2
00:47:52.688 --> 00:47:57.564
on your instruction files that indicate
that.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/295-0
00:47:57.684 --> 00:48:00.484
They are instruction files dot MD files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/296-0
00:48:01.724 --> 00:48:02.604
All right.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/297-0
00:48:04.484 --> 00:48:08.962
Now let's talk about meta instructions
that I've listed for what I would deal

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/297-1
00:48:08.962 --> 00:48:13.554
with meta instruction files that we'll
we'll talk about in some depth because I

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/297-2
00:48:13.554 --> 00:48:18.032
think these are really useful and they
are applicable across any project that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/297-3
00:48:18.032 --> 00:48:19.524
you might be working with.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/298-0
00:48:20.084 --> 00:48:24.617
The first one is important or actually
the first two work together.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/298-1
00:48:24.617 --> 00:48:28.217
The the first one is AI assisted output
instructions.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/298-2
00:48:28.217 --> 00:48:33.551
These are instructions that are to guide
how the AI creates the output and I'll

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/298-3
00:48:33.551 --> 00:48:38.684
get into the in depth about this,
but this is very powerful way of defining.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/299-0
00:48:40.604 --> 00:48:45.553
When the AI creates an output,
what it should include in that output

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/299-1
00:48:45.553 --> 00:48:51.363
over and above what the prompt is asking
for and the copilot instruction file or

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/299-2
00:48:51.363 --> 00:48:55.165
instruction files are for using copilot
effectively.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/299-3
00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:59.684
So you have a specific way that you want
copilot to behave or.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/300-0
00:48:59.764 --> 00:49:05.410
That you want Copilot to be aware of,
you can put it there.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/300-1
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:10.774
The third one is an instruction prompt
instruction file.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/300-2
00:49:10.774 --> 00:49:16.044
So this is instructions for creating
effective prompts.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/301-0
00:49:16.244 --> 00:49:19.327
So,
so the idea here is that if I if I

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/301-1
00:49:19.327 --> 00:49:25.414
execute this or I put this into my
project, whenever I create a prompt file,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/301-2
00:49:25.414 --> 00:49:26.284
I actually.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/302-0
00:49:27.444 --> 00:49:30.434
Yeah,
then it will follow these instructions

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/302-1
00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:35.284
and make sure that prompt file conforms
to a particular standard and has

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/302-2
00:49:35.284 --> 00:49:40.666
particular particular aspects about it.
It allows you to standardize the the the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/302-3
00:49:40.666 --> 00:49:46.180
way in which instructions are built or a
prop files are built and it allows you to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/302-4
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.044
to to define.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/303-0
00:49:47.444 --> 00:49:53.251
What every prop file should have in terms
of its structure and the 4th one here is

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/303-1
00:49:53.251 --> 00:49:57.519
a prompt file instruction and it's
instructions for prompts.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/303-2
00:49:57.519 --> 00:50:03.396
It's a little bit more targeted than this
that actually generate instruction files.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/303-3
00:50:03.396 --> 00:50:06.964
So this helps you define what you would
create or.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/304-0
00:50:07.044 --> 00:50:12.851
Have in your instruction.
So I wanna switch now to the AI assisted

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/304-1
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:14.844
and this is the test 1.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/305-0
00:50:21.924 --> 00:50:22.724
Yeah, OK.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/308-0
00:50:35.284 --> 00:50:41.779
All right, so this has a bunch of.
This is the the the one of the one of the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/308-1
00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:47.683
repositories that I suggested that you
would fork. It has chat modes,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/308-2
00:50:47.683 --> 00:50:53.924
instruction files, prompts in it.
It has some scripts and some workflows.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/309-0
00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:57.284
Um defined in it and um.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/310-0
00:50:58.804 --> 00:51:04.500
So let's talk about the instruction files,
and let's talk specifically about these

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/310-1
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.138
instruction files here.
The instruction file output.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/310-2
00:51:08.138 --> 00:51:12.324
It's just an output one is, I think,
a very interesting one.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/311-0
00:51:14.724 --> 00:51:20.284
And let me open that a new window so we
can see the whole thing.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/312-0
00:51:22.924 --> 00:51:30.290
So notice that this file has a a header
assigned to it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/312-1
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:38.444
This is a metadata and it specifies a
number of things about.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/313-0
00:51:38.644 --> 00:51:44.429
How it is how AI assisted output should
be created and one of the things that it

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/313-1
00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:50.071
it specifies is that it should that all
your AI generated output should have a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/313-2
00:51:50.071 --> 00:51:54.284
header that describes what was the prompt
that created it.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/314-0
00:51:55.364 --> 00:52:02.417
How long it took to execute that there
should be an A I log with the with that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/314-1
00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:09.381
conversation so that you record what the
actual conversation was and what the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/314-2
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:11.524
output was from the A I.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/315-0
00:52:11.804 --> 00:52:18.300
What was the source of this,
which is the the prompt file that was

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/315-1
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.244
actually executed and what it should
apply to and.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/316-0
00:52:24.364 --> 00:52:25.964
So these uh.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/317-0
00:52:27.924 --> 00:52:32.809
So some some of the benefits.
So this is a we want clear provenance for

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/317-1
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:35.862
this.
We want to be able to have actually an

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/317-2
00:52:35.862 --> 00:52:40.814
audit trail that will allow us to
understand how AI was actually used to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/317-3
00:52:40.814 --> 00:52:43.324
create the artifacts in a repository.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/318-0
00:52:43.764 --> 00:52:50.201
And notice it has a a whole list of
things that it wants to have included and

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/318-1
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:55.235
you know things like enforcement within
the C CICD pipeline,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/318-2
00:52:55.235 --> 00:53:00.764
the copilot implementation requirements
and here it's referencing.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/319-0
00:53:01.164 --> 00:53:06.985
Some GitHub Copilot implementation.
These are all different sections that we

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/319-1
00:53:06.985 --> 00:53:11.294
can view the chocolate.
There's a chat logging workflow,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/319-2
00:53:11.294 --> 00:53:16.284
and it's the placement and naming of
things, the implementations.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/320-0
00:53:16.644 --> 00:53:21.494
The scope, the terminology,
a whole range of things that we want to

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/320-1
00:53:21.494 --> 00:53:24.918
have in the output that's created.
Like I said,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/320-2
00:53:24.918 --> 00:53:30.624
the main benefit of this I think is 2
things is it it it requires that you have

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/320-3
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:32.764
some metadata here about this.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/321-0
00:53:33.244 --> 00:53:37.952
In all the files that that can support it
in line, and if it doesn't,

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/321-1
00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:42.593
if it if it doesn't support it,
like say it's an artifact which is a

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/321-2
00:53:42.593 --> 00:53:46.225
binary file,
it will it'll create a sidecar file that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/321-3
00:53:46.225 --> 00:53:51.404
contains this metadata about that file
and and so that way you'll have this.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/322-0
00:53:52.044 --> 00:53:55.378
this metadata that describes the content
of the file.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/322-1
00:53:55.378 --> 00:53:59.885
And then the other thing I think is
important about this is that it will

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/322-2
00:53:59.885 --> 00:54:03.652
create this AI log,
which actually allows you to do a couple

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/322-3
00:54:03.652 --> 00:54:06.862
of different things.
One is that it does record the

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/322-4
00:54:06.862 --> 00:54:09.764
conversation history for that particular
chat.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/323-0
00:54:10.844 --> 00:54:17.204
A session and it also creates a summary
file of that chat session which is

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/323-1
00:54:17.204 --> 00:54:22.631
suitable for renewing.
So you can essentially once that summary

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/323-2
00:54:22.631 --> 00:54:28.822
file is committed to source code,
some other developer or you at a later

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/323-3
00:54:28.822 --> 00:54:29.924
time can add.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/324-0
00:54:30.244 --> 00:54:36.150
Add that summary file to your context and
it will allow you to resume that process

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/324-1
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:41.415
at the point that it left off and it will
keep track in the session file.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/324-2
00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:46.324
If you're in a multi step operation,
what step was the current step?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/325-0
00:54:46.924 --> 00:54:51.272
What the context was of that of that
current step and then it will allow you

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/325-1
00:54:51.272 --> 00:54:55.506
to actually resume that session,
which is a really handy feature if you're

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/325-2
00:54:55.506 --> 00:54:59.854
you're in a if you're in a chat session
that is going to be lengthy and it's

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/325-3
00:54:59.854 --> 00:55:03.524
going to involve a lot of back and forth
between you and the AI.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/326-0
00:55:03.924 --> 00:55:12.955
Is to be able to essentially update that
summary file and then you can clear your

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/326-1
00:55:12.955 --> 00:55:20.884
chat window to clear up your context
window and then just add that one.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/327-0
00:55:21.364 --> 00:55:25.774
That one summary file back into your
context and you can then resume that

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/327-1
00:55:25.774 --> 00:55:27.204
operation at that point.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/328-0
00:55:29.684 --> 00:55:32.324
So any questions on that?

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/329-0
00:55:33.524 --> 00:55:37.204
Let me let me show you some.
We've seen examples of that go ahead.

674e1938-d3f6-408e-b77e-2ac0de3e401a/330-0
00:55:36.924 --> 00:55:40.717
