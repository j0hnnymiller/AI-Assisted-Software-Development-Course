00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:05.877
<v John Miller>So Greenfield development.
But first I wanted to give you an update</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/92-1
00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:11.041
<v John Miller>on this exercise that we finished up with
yesterday about running prompts and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/92-2
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.895
<v John Miller>GitHub workflows. So let me.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/93-0
00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.135
<v John Miller>Show you this first.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/98-0
00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:29.853
<v John Miller>So this is this is a test we I submitted
a a request or PR that had a a a number</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/98-1
00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:34.935
<v John Miller>of issues of intentional violations in it
and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/100-0
00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:40.821
<v John Miller>We look down at the bottom.
After all of this, we'll see that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/100-1
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.175
<v John Miller>Where was that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/106-0
00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.604
<v John Miller>Yeah,
see here that it's actually evaluated</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/106-1
00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:52.761
<v John Miller>those and and notice that there are style
check valid failures and categorized</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/106-2
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:58.607
<v John Miller>those and described you know exactly what
those issues were that it found.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/106-3
00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:02.815
<v John Miller>So this is what we were looking to try to
accomplish.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/109-0
00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:17.289
<v John Miller>We wanted to make sure that we could run
a prompt in a PR hook and have it execute</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/109-1
00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.975
<v John Miller>and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/110-0
00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:19.375
<v John Miller>Update that a comment.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/113-0
00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.742
<v John Miller>Um, if I found something,
so that's that's cool.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/113-1
00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:26.638
<v John Miller>So let me just talk about how we how I
got to that place.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/113-2
00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:28.535
<v John Miller>It was kind of an interesting journey.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/118-0
00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:36.350
<v John Miller>So First off, let's look here.
This is the file that I sent it and you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/118-1
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.304
<v John Miller>can see there's comments about the the
violations that it was expecting or I I I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/118-2
00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:44.935
<v John Miller>had introduced and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/119-0
00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:50.815
<v John Miller>This is the final version of the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/123-0
00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:58.743
<v John Miller>Of the of the workflow.
So so the first thing I did after class</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/123-1
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:02.215
<v John Miller>in order to to to work this out was I.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/127-0
00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:06.500
<v John Miller>I just said,
well let's just go evaluate the file</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/127-1
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.423
<v John Miller>against the the the instruction file and
make sure that it actually finds an issue</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/127-2
00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.447
<v John Miller>and it it did.
So that was so that just told me it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/127-3
00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:17.828
<v John Miller>wasn't the file.
It was definitely something that needed</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/127-4
00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:18.895
<v John Miller>to be done in the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/131-0
00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:25.314
<v John Miller>Pipeline or the workflow. So.
So the next thing I I did was I gave it a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/131-1
00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:31.175
<v John Miller>a pretty a pretty large prompt that says
that this can yeah, yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/134-0
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:33.844
<v Majernik, Peter>John, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Are you showing the screen that you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/134-1
00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:37.179
<v Majernik, Peter>talking about?
Because we are still looking at the pull</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/132-0
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.935
<v John Miller>Oh, I'm sorry.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/134-2
00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.655
<v Majernik, Peter>request.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/135-0
00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:38.495
<v John Miller>I'm sorry.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/139-0
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:43.715
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, that's OK.
I was just wondering if something should</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/138-0
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:43.375
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/139-1
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:44.775
<v Majernik, Peter>be changing there.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/140-0
00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:48.215
<v John Miller>Oh yeah,
something should be changing there.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/143-0
00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:52.135
<v John Miller>All right, so let me go back back.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/142-0
00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:50.615
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/145-0
00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:53.575
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thank you.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/147-0
00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:58.335
<v John Miller>Well, Sir, thanks for pointing it out.
So the first thing I did was.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/152-0
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:08.861
<v John Miller>I I I ran it locally and and it did it
did find the issues. So I I did this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/152-1
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:15.390
<v John Miller>I created this prompt and said this
committed introduced an intentional style</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/152-2
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.655
<v John Miller>violation and then I said this was the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/157-0
00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.911
<v John Miller>Style checker.
This is a link to the actual job that had</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/157-1
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:28.012
<v John Miller>the where it didn't fail and it says it
passed. I expected it to fail.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/157-2
00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:33.904
<v John Miller>It explained why it failed and this is
what it came back with almost immediately.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/157-3
00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:38.215
<v John Miller>It says the workflow is currently using a
hard coded place.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/161-0
00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:41.986
<v John Miller>It would always returns pass.
So what happened?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/161-1
00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:47.864
<v John Miller>What we didn't do is we actually didn't
look at the output that it created and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/161-2
00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:53.890
<v John Miller>the South check version had right at the
top that said you need to choose one of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/161-3
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.015
<v John Miller>these three methods which is either using.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/166-0
00:03:57.335 --> 00:04:03.671
<v John Miller>GitHub Copilot Open AI or Azure Open AI
as an option and uncomment the code for</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/166-1
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.739
<v John Miller>that whichever one you picked.
So you can see here that it is a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/166-2
00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.728
<v John Miller>temporary placeholder and asked to remove
some of the options.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/166-3
00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:16.975
<v John Miller>So if we had looked at the code we could.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/171-0
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:20.480
<v John Miller>That it produced.
We would have seen this and actually</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/171-1
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.110
<v John Miller>identified that that was that we had to
actually make some changes and the AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/171-2
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.918
<v John Miller>wasn't actually gonna go any farther than
just suggesting what what the possible</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/171-3
00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:32.055
<v John Miller>solutions were. So then I went in I.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/176-0
00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:42.210
<v John Miller>I I didn't said I I went in and
uncommented the one for the for the the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/176-1
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.055
<v John Miller>copilot CLI and I got a change and it
this was an interesting in that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/178-0
00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:56.406
<v John Miller>The first change it suggested was a was a
very minor like a commented like I added</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/178-1
00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:59.255
<v John Miller>a comment and I came back and said well.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/179-0
00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:00.455
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/187-0
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:08.118
<v John Miller>So when it ran it,
the first time it ran it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/187-1
00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:15.341
<v John Miller>it tried to run the GitHub copilot and it
the command itself failed and then it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/187-2
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:22.112
<v John Miller>says that the then it said the GitHub CLI
doesn't have a copilot extension</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/187-3
00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:23.015
<v John Miller>installed.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/189-0
00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:28.695
<v John Miller>So you made a modification to the style
check for that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/193-0
00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:36.765
<v John Miller>And it in order to and it and it it and
what it did it was actually wanted to use</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/193-1
00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:42.390
<v John Miller>the open AIAPI instead.
So I I actually stopped it and I I I said</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/193-2
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.095
<v John Miller>I wanted to use the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/196-0
00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:51.383
<v John Miller>And it said can we install the GitHub
copilot CLI extension instead of the on</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/196-1
00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:53.655
<v John Miller>the runner and it came back.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/200-0
00:05:55.215 --> 00:06:01.898
<v John Miller>And so yeah, yeah, we can do that.
So we modified this the the YAML file</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/200-1
00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:08.215
<v John Miller>again to do to do the GitHub Copilot CLI
instead of the open AI one.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/202-0
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:14.055
<v John Miller>And when that when that ran.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/204-0
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:18.215
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/206-0
00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.415
<v John Miller>We got this error.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/211-0
00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:29.512
<v John Miller>And error that said it was calling the
substring function,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/211-1
00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:34.738
<v John Miller>so it it it failed because it was trying
to call a a a function that didn't</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/211-2
00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:38.520
<v John Miller>actually exist.
And so we made another modification to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/211-3
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.095
<v John Miller>that and eventually what we ended up with
was that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/212-0
00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:47.495
<v John Miller>Where was that recommendation?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/218-0
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:53.657
<v John Miller>So it continued.
We went back and forth about this to try</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/218-1
00:06:53.657 --> 00:06:59.497
<v John Miller>to get to a point and and basically what
it came back and said the suggest command</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/218-2
00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:04.705
<v John Miller>is not the right tool for the task.
It's designed for interactive command</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/218-3
00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:08.575
<v John Miller>suggestions and not structured data
analysis and that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/222-0
00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:14.366
<v John Miller>CLI is trying to insert our prompt as a
shell command and returning an error and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/222-1
00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:18.885
<v John Miller>then it wants to switch back again to the
Open AI version of it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/222-2
00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:24.447
<v John Miller>And the reason I was shying away from
this is because it was requesting an Open</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/222-3
00:07:24.447 --> 00:07:27.575
<v John Miller>AI API key and I didn't have an Open AI
key.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/228-0
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.359
<v John Miller>So,
but then the end of end result of it was</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/228-1
00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:36.783
<v John Miller>that the only the only real solution was
actually to try to use Open AI.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/228-2
00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:42.728
<v John Miller>And so I went and got an Open AI key and
signed up for that which I hadn't done</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/228-3
00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:47.335
<v John Miller>yet and then got an Open AI key and added
it into the GitHub.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/233-0
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:55.409
<v John Miller>Secrets store and it and then it worked.
So the so here's it telling you how to go</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/233-1
00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:02.250
<v John Miller>go about getting a an open AI key and
getting and storing it as a secret.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/233-2
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.335
<v John Miller>And so I said OK,
I've added that API key as a secret.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/238-0
00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:12.732
<v John Miller>Then we went kind of back and forth.
I thought that was kind of fun.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/238-1
00:08:12.732 --> 00:08:16.989
<v John Miller>But once I I said that, I said OK,
this it made a modification that's</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/238-2
00:08:16.989 --> 00:08:21.612
<v John Miller>basically suggested a very small change
to the file. And then I said, well,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/238-3
00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:26.295
<v John Miller>that style check only looks at the
changes, so this small change won't work.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/240-0
00:08:28.095 --> 00:08:30.675
<v John Miller>And then he says, Oh yeah,
you're right about that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/240-1
00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:32.015
<v John Miller>It's always says I'm right.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/241-0
00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:33.695
<v John Miller>And then?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/246-0
00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:39.672
<v John Miller>I had asked it to make another
modifications another,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/246-1
00:08:39.672 --> 00:08:46.168
<v John Miller>but it came back with another small
change and so I basically had to create a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/246-2
00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:51.415
<v John Miller>brand new file which is this this first
version here and then.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/250-0
00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:56.006
<v John Miller>It wanted to go back and make a small
modification to this file and I had to go</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/250-1
00:08:56.006 --> 00:08:59.590
<v John Miller>back and tell it no,
you need to use a much more comprehensive</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/250-2
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.141
<v John Miller>set of you had to create a new file so
that would actually have some diffs that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/250-3
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.815
<v John Miller>would allow it to execute and then
eventually.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/254-0
00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:19.289
<v John Miller>Eventually the the the style ran the the
workflow was triggered and it was able to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/254-1
00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:23.375
<v John Miller>update the PRPR request and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/256-0
00:09:23.935 --> 00:09:31.255
<v John Miller>And add the comment to the PR.
Any question on that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/259-0
00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:41.655
<v Majernik, Peter>What would be the equivalent of using
these open API keys in Azure DevOps?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/264-0
00:09:42.855 --> 00:09:46.012
<v John Miller>There is an there is an addition.
The third,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/264-1
00:09:46.012 --> 00:09:51.344
<v John Miller>the third suggestion that it made in
addition to Open AI is that there's an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/264-2
00:09:51.344 --> 00:09:55.273
<v John Miller>Azure Open AI and you would, but I don't.
Well, I have.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/264-3
00:09:55.273 --> 00:10:00.325
<v John Miller>I have access to Azure DevOps,
but I didn't have really the time to get</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/264-4
00:10:00.325 --> 00:10:00.535
<v John Miller>to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/269-0
00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:05.984
<v John Miller>To create a project in Azure DevOps and
incorporate it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/269-1
00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:12.432
<v John Miller>but it'd be basically the same thing.
You would use Azure Open AI instead of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/269-2
00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:16.535
<v John Miller>just the standard Open AI and provide it
with a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/273-0
00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:21.103
<v John Miller>A token and you should be able to run the
same thing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/273-1
00:10:21.103 --> 00:10:27.535
<v John Miller>And I also did a little bit of research
in Azure DevOps in terms of implementing</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/273-2
00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:32.775
<v John Miller>this in Azure DevOps and it has the
support it needs in order to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/274-0
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.855
<v John Miller>Update the PR. Update the PRS.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/276-0
00:10:33.295 --> 00:10:37.095
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, as long as it's possible,
we'll figure it out.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/278-0
00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.102
<v John Miller>Yeah,
it's it's definitely possible and it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/278-1
00:10:40.102 --> 00:10:43.415
<v John Miller>would it would work pretty much the same
way as it's working here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/279-0
00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:45.335
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/281-0
00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:46.855
<v John Miller>Alright, so alright.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/287-0
00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:49.681
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>John,
would you would you should be able to to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/287-1
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:53.334
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>share with us.
It looks like you had some fun yesterday</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/287-2
00:10:53.334 --> 00:10:58.553
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>after we finished figuring it all out.
How much effort was it on your end to to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/284-0
00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:58.135
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/287-3
00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:03.968
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>maybe debug and come to those conclusions?
So just just looking for some reference</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/287-4
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:06.055
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>number. Are we talking you know?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/288-0
00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:09.575
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Half an hour or three hours or five hours.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/295-0
00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.607
<v John Miller>But no, I was.
I would say between 1/2 an hour and an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/295-1
00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:15.377
<v John Miller>hour it it was working. You know,
most of it. I was, you know,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/289-0
00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:11.855
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/291-0
00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:14.695
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/295-2
00:11:15.377 --> 00:11:20.284
<v John Miller>if I'd had taken its advice right off the
bat and and if I already had an open AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/295-3
00:11:20.284 --> 00:11:23.096
<v John Miller>key,
it would have been much quicker than that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/293-0
00:11:22.695 --> 00:11:22.935
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Right.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/295-4
00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:23.575
<v John Miller>because.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/301-0
00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:30.848
<v John Miller>I would have just been able to add that
open AI key to the GitHub repo and it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/301-1
00:11:30.848 --> 00:11:35.432
<v John Miller>would have been able to kick that off
right away.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/301-2
00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:43.135
<v John Miller>I just thought it was interesting in the
sense that it kind of to me it emphasized.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/298-0
00:11:36.415 --> 00:11:36.535
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>But.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/304-0
00:11:43.215 --> 00:11:49.462
<v John Miller>The need for us to actually go and look
at the output that's created because it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/304-1
00:11:49.462 --> 00:11:55.709
<v John Miller>created something that would pass every
single time and it asked us to actually</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/304-2
00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.895
<v John Miller>make a decision in the code.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/308-0
00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:01.249
<v John Miller>About how what approach we actually
wanted to take.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/308-1
00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:04.554
<v John Miller>And that wasn't really evident from the
output that I saw,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/308-2
00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:08.700
<v John Miller>but it was definitely something that we
needed to go. And it was kind of,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/308-3
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.006
<v John Miller>it was kind of like when he comes back
and says, oh, well,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/308-4
00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:13.855
<v John Miller>it's always gonna pass, you know?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/312-0
00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:17.511
<v John Miller>It's hard coded that way and you need to
make a decision. I thought that was,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/312-1
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:20.933
<v John Miller>I thought that was an interesting
response and an interesting way to go,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/312-2
00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:22.855
<v John Miller>but it wasn't. It wasn't a lot of effort.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/311-0
00:12:23.135 --> 00:12:23.735
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/314-0
00:12:28.575 --> 00:12:30.295
<v John Miller>The other thing I did was um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/316-0
00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:35.655
<v John Miller>Was a little more fun. It was um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/321-0
00:12:38.255 --> 00:12:43.988
<v John Miller>I think it's this guy, right? Right.
So I had this notion we we've talked</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/321-1
00:12:43.988 --> 00:12:48.326
<v John Miller>about, you know,
managing our context and I've had this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/321-2
00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:53.826
<v John Miller>notion all along that I'm that I'm not.
I could do a better job at it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/321-3
00:12:53.826 --> 00:12:55.375
<v John Miller>So what I did was I.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/325-0
00:12:56.655 --> 00:12:59.607
<v John Miller>I had this.
I had this idea that I want to implement.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/325-1
00:12:59.607 --> 00:13:03.706
<v John Miller>I'll show you a little bit later,
probably tomorrow about how to implement</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/325-2
00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:06.931
<v John Miller>code in using something called a vertical
slice. Have you?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/325-3
00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:08.735
<v John Miller>Have you ever familiar with that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/326-0
00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:10.615
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>No.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/330-0
00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:17.208
<v John Miller>So a vertical slice says you take a
project and you break it down into</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/330-1
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:24.231
<v John Miller>features where the whole feature can be
implemented from the the UI all the way</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/330-2
00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:27.655
<v John Miller>through into the persistent data store.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/334-0
00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:30.765
<v John Miller>So it can be.
It's like a completely demonstrable</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/334-1
00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:33.368
<v John Miller>feature.
So you start off with the very first</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/334-2
00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:38.065
<v John Miller>thing that you do is to analyze the code
and try to figure out the the project and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/334-3
00:13:38.065 --> 00:13:42.082
<v John Miller>try to figure out how to build,
how to implement it in vertical slices</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/334-4
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:42.535
<v John Miller>and the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/339-0
00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:47.106
<v John Miller>The main benefit that I see from it,
there are actually two things.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/339-1
00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:51.904
<v John Miller>One is that it gets you into a place
where you've got working code much faster</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/339-2
00:13:51.904 --> 00:13:56.460
<v John Miller>than if you start to go in a layered
approach where you build out the data</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/339-3
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.319
<v John Miller>tier and then you build up the middle
tier on top of that and then you build up</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/339-4
00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:02.655
<v John Miller>the UI on top of that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/344-0
00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:07.069
<v John Miller>To get to the point where you can
actually show somebody something working</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/344-1
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:10.301
<v John Miller>is much farther along.
So here you can actually say, OK,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/344-2
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:14.612
<v John Miller>I wanna create this one piece and it's
only gonna do this one little thing,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/344-3
00:14:14.612 --> 00:14:19.149
<v John Miller>but it's gonna do it all the way through
the whole stack and I would include in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/344-4
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.495
<v John Miller>that whole stack the ability to push it
into a production.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/348-0
00:14:22.615 --> 00:14:27.562
<v John Miller>Environment going through even a test
environment before. it gets there.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/348-1
00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:32.645
<v John Miller>So a full CICD implementation that
implements one small piece of the final</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/348-2
00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:37.795
<v John Miller>solution that you're trying to build.
So I think that's a really attractive</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/348-3
00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:41.183
<v John Miller>person.
The reason that I think it appealed to me</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/348-4
00:14:41.183 --> 00:14:42.335
<v John Miller>for this is that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/353-0
00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:48.840
<v John Miller>The process I'm going to show you today
that I've been evolving in by taking a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/353-1
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.045
<v John Miller>layered approach to it,
it would be like several steps into the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/353-2
00:14:54.045 --> 00:15:00.633
<v John Miller>process before I would get any feedback
at all about anything was working and to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/353-3
00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.015
<v John Miller>get to the point.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/357-0
00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:09.235
<v John Miller>I actually start implementing the AI.
I had to build out all of these layers in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/357-1
00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:15.148
<v John Miller>order for I can actually see what the AI
would actually look like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/357-2
00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:19.295
<v John Miller>So I wanted a process to get me that
feedback.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/361-0
00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:24.530
<v John Miller>Much much faster so I can adjust the
process and make incremental improvements</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/361-1
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.798
<v John Miller>on it as I'm doing the implementation and
a vertical slice approach is is a great</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/361-2
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:34.231
<v John Miller>way I think to do to do that.
So I wanted to create some instruction</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/361-3
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.415
<v John Miller>files and I started off with this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/365-0
00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:41.542
<v John Miller>One instruction file here,
which is business rules to vertical</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/365-1
00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:47.469
<v John Miller>slices. So the idea is that it, well,
actually it wasn't quite the first one I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/365-2
00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:51.520
<v John Miller>came up with.
It was a vertical slices implementation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/365-3
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.495
<v John Miller>instructions.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/370-0
00:15:52.975 --> 00:15:58.746
<v John Miller>And what this was is that it is, you know,
if you were going to create a vertical</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/370-1
00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:02.053
<v John Miller>slice,
what is the the process that you go for</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/370-2
00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:05.501
<v John Miller>in order to actually create that vertical
slice?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/370-3
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:10.920
<v John Miller>And you notice that it's it's doing a
feature centric organization of of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/370-4
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.975
<v John Miller>implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/373-0
00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:16.956
<v John Miller>So everything goes under a feature,
then there's an under features,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/373-1
00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:20.895
<v John Miller>then there's a feature,
then you have some implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/374-0
00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:22.769
<v Majernik, Peter>John,
I think we are looking at the other</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/374-1
00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:23.255
<v Majernik, Peter>screen.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/376-0
00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:28.815
<v John Miller>Oh, easy guys. Bye. No, no, no, I'm sorry.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/379-0
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:30.918
<v Majernik, Peter>Sorry,
can can I also throw in a question at the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/379-1
00:16:30.918 --> 00:16:31.935
<v Majernik, Peter>same time?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/380-0
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:33.015
<v John Miller>Why not?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/382-0
00:16:33.175 --> 00:16:36.254
<v Majernik, Peter>Related to this,
does this have anything to do with</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/382-1
00:16:36.254 --> 00:16:40.575
<v Majernik, Peter>feature flags and are you using any kind
of framework for feature flags?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/386-0
00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:44.175
<v John Miller>No,
I'm saying that it definitely would tie</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/386-1
00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:48.151
<v John Miller>to a feature flag because it's organized
by features.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/386-2
00:16:48.151 --> 00:16:54.189
<v John Miller>It'd be very easy to add a feature flag
to this and so that each feature that can</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/386-3
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:55.735
<v John Miller>be turned on and off.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/391-0
00:16:55.935 --> 00:17:01.824
<v John Miller>And one of the reasons I kind of wanted
to go down this approach is I wanted to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/391-1
00:17:01.824 --> 00:17:07.271
<v John Miller>try to see if I could speed up the
process by by taking advantage of like</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/391-2
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:12.055
<v John Miller>this ability to defer or delegate the
implementation to to some.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/396-0
00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:17.117
<v John Miller>To the AI and have it go out and create a
create a a a branch and then make a PR</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/396-1
00:17:17.117 --> 00:17:21.509
<v John Miller>for that branch and then I can merge
those branches together. But yeah,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/396-2
00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:25.719
<v John Miller>it would it would dovetail.
I think it would dovetail very well with</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/394-0
00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:23.815
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/396-3
00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:29.135
<v John Miller>that and it wouldn't be very difficult to
to implement.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/399-0
00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:34.009
<v John Miller>All right,
so let me open this up in a preview and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/399-1
00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:41.201
<v John Miller>just going to go over it since it's a new
concept and let's bring this into a new</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/399-2
00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:41.815
<v John Miller>window.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/401-0
00:17:45.495 --> 00:17:45.655
<v John Miller>Mm.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/403-0
00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.615
<v John Miller>Here we go.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/409-0
00:17:57.735 --> 00:18:01.919
<v John Miller>So it it it's a feature centric
organization of your project where you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/409-1
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:06.043
<v John Miller>have features and under those features
you have things like you know,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/409-2
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:10.757
<v John Miller>a user registration, a product search,
whatever the actual features are instead</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/409-3
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.055
<v John Miller>of a structure that's organized around.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/413-0
00:18:13.295 --> 00:18:17.236
<v John Miller>The artifacts, controllers,
services and repositories.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/413-1
00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:22.395
<v John Miller>So that's a different way of thinking
about how to implement a project.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/413-2
00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:28.127
<v John Miller>And when you look at the underlying user
registration here, you have a command,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/413-3
00:18:28.127 --> 00:18:29.775
<v John Miller>a handler, a validator.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/418-0
00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:33.820
<v John Miller>A registration repository data transfer
object.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/418-1
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.384
<v John Miller>So you have all of the underneath that
feature.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/418-2
00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:43.400
<v John Miller>You have all of the related artifacts
associated with implementing that feature,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/418-3
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.415
<v John Miller>and then you have vertical independence
that each slice should be independently.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/422-0
00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:54.320
<v John Miller>Deployable, testable and understandable.
So when you come back and you've already</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/422-1
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.418
<v John Miller>implemented a feature and you need to
make a change to it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/422-2
00:18:57.418 --> 00:19:01.198
<v John Miller>all of the files are necessary.
They're there and you can actually work</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/422-3
00:19:01.198 --> 00:19:04.505
<v John Miller>on it and deploy it.
A thin shared kernel so that you keep the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/422-4
00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:05.135
<v John Miller>shared code.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/423-0
00:19:05.135 --> 00:19:08.375
<v John Miller>Minimal and focus on true cost cutting
concerns.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/427-0
00:19:10.095 --> 00:19:14.355
<v John Miller>Um, here's a high level structure.
We talked about that where you have</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/427-1
00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:18.315
<v John Miller>features and then you have common common
pieces of code, the API,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/427-2
00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:19.815
<v John Miller>the database and testing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/432-0
00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:27.990
<v John Miller>There's a request flow then that
describes the endpoint reason request</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/432-1
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:34.780
<v John Miller>that's mapped to a command community
object into a mediator or a router</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/432-2
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:40.815
<v John Miller>handler executed in feature logic and
then he returns a result.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/435-0
00:19:40.815 --> 00:19:45.352
<v John Miller>Response back to the caller and the API
maps that results in HTTP response.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/435-1
00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:49.112
<v John Miller>This uses an an architecture,
or at least it dovetails with an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/435-2
00:19:49.112 --> 00:19:52.335
<v John Miller>architecture called CQRS.
Are you familiar with that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/436-0
00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:52.535
<v John Miller>That.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/441-0
00:19:54.135 --> 00:20:04.476
<v John Miller>It's it's CQRS stands for Command Query
Response structure and it what it does is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/441-1
00:20:04.476 --> 00:20:10.655
<v John Miller>it isolates the the the processing of a
command.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/446-0
00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:16.243
<v John Miller>From the response itself.
So the idea is that you would send a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/446-1
00:20:16.243 --> 00:20:21.444
<v John Miller>command in and then you that command
would then be processed is processed</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/446-2
00:20:21.444 --> 00:20:26.575
<v John Miller>usually using an event driven type of
architecture and then it takes and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/446-3
00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:31.495
<v John Miller>produces a response that comes back out
of it and the two things are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/449-0
00:20:31.575 --> 00:20:39.935
<v John Miller>Independent of each other other and they
it is the it's it's the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/450-0
00:20:41.215 --> 00:20:41.255
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/455-0
00:20:44.695 --> 00:20:51.980
<v John Miller>It's the the the independent over.
They're implemented independently and you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/455-1
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:59.170
<v John Miller>can use the command side of things that
you're actually making a request is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/455-2
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.535
<v John Miller>optimized explicitly for.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/460-0
00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:07.744
<v John Miller>Receiving those and processing those
requests as quickly as possible and the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/460-1
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:13.621
<v John Miller>output section of it is optimized for
retrieving the information to respond to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/460-2
00:21:13.621 --> 00:21:19.722
<v John Miller>the request and sending that result back.
So they're highly decoupled in terms of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/460-3
00:21:19.722 --> 00:21:21.135
<v John Miller>their capabilities.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/464-0
00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:28.327
<v John Miller>And they can be optimized all the way
down to the database level to the point</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/464-1
00:21:28.327 --> 00:21:35.594
<v John Miller>where the response side of things could
be substantially denormalized in order to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/464-2
00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:38.695
<v John Miller>optimize the return response times.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/469-0
00:21:38.895 --> 00:21:42.414
<v John Miller>Yeah,
so this architecture goes well with this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/469-1
00:21:42.414 --> 00:21:46.231
<v John Miller>implementation strategy implementation
guidelines.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/469-2
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:49.899
<v John Miller>Each feature should show a consistent
structure.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/469-3
00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:54.466
<v John Miller>This is what the user registration
function might look like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/469-4
00:21:54.466 --> 00:21:57.535
<v John Miller>And then you have a command query object.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/475-0
00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:03.188
<v John Miller>For request objects,
which then you essentially send in a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/475-1
00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:09.407
<v John Miller>request that gets put into an event queue
that eventually something will pick up</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/475-2
00:22:09.407 --> 00:22:14.397
<v John Miller>out of that event queue.
It will process that command and during</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/475-3
00:22:14.397 --> 00:22:17.775
<v John Miller>the process of that command it will go
and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/478-0
00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:23.289
<v John Miller>And do the response sign so that you have
a response process that will produce a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/478-1
00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:26.343
<v John Miller>result.
So you have a command query object that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/478-2
00:22:26.343 --> 00:22:29.652
<v John Miller>is a request.
You have a handler that actually does</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/478-3
00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:33.215
<v John Miller>that handles that request.
Then you do some validation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/484-0
00:22:33.655 --> 00:22:39.479
<v John Miller>There's a validation pipeline.
Then you do data access and using a DB</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/484-1
00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:43.638
<v John Miller>context,
you have a pattern for API endpoints and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/484-2
00:22:43.638 --> 00:22:47.382
<v John Miller>feature.
And then we kind of talked about an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/484-3
00:22:47.382 --> 00:22:53.455
<v John Miller>example of feature organization here with
the code structure looks like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/488-0
00:22:53.575 --> 00:22:56.584
<v John Miller>So anyway,
this is an interesting way I think of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/488-1
00:22:56.584 --> 00:23:01.743
<v John Miller>approaching the implementation and I like
the idea of having these vertical slices.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/488-2
00:23:01.743 --> 00:23:06.656
<v John Miller>So I wanted to try to incorporate this
into this process so that we could do an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/488-3
00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:11.507
<v John Miller>exercise where we just try to implement
one feature and see if we can get that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/488-4
00:23:11.507 --> 00:23:12.735
<v John Miller>one feature to work.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/494-0
00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:19.791
<v John Miller>So as I was looking at this,
I was kind of thinking, well,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/494-1
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:23.808
<v John Miller>this is kind of like a lot of.
There's a lot of text here,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/494-2
00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:28.096
<v John Miller>a lot of example code,
and I'm thinking this is gonna eat up a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/494-3
00:23:28.096 --> 00:23:33.066
<v John Miller>lot of my token window, right?
Just to have the instruction files loaded</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/494-4
00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:34.495
<v John Miller>and have it actually.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/497-0
00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:40.095
<v John Miller>Active in in my context window.
So I I asked copilot if there was ways</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/497-1
00:23:40.095 --> 00:23:46.073
<v John Miller>that this could be optimized for an AI
assistant and he came back and said yeah,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/497-2
00:23:46.073 --> 00:23:49.615
<v John Miller>there's a lot of optimization that we
could do.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/499-0
00:23:50.135 --> 00:23:52.735
<v John Miller>And So what I I had it do some of that
optimization.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/502-0
00:23:55.775 --> 00:24:02.975
<v John Miller>And how to create a AI version of that of
these?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/506-0
00:24:04.215 --> 00:24:09.570
<v John Miller>This vertical slice implementation.
So here's the A I to business role.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/506-1
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.916
<v John Miller>Here's the vertical slice A I version of
it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/506-2
00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:19.014
<v John Miller>and it's substantially more to the point,
and it's focused not on more conceptual</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/506-3
00:24:19.014 --> 00:24:20.055
<v John Miller>concepts, but.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/512-0
00:24:20.135 --> 00:24:25.268
<v John Miller>How do you go about actually doing this?
And so it has a checklist and how to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/512-1
00:24:25.268 --> 00:24:28.427
<v John Miller>implement these vertical slice
implementations.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/512-2
00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:33.166
<v John Miller>And so I think this is kind of an
interesting point because then what I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/512-3
00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:38.562
<v John Miller>added it to do is to take a look at all
the instructions that I have in this file</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/512-4
00:24:38.562 --> 00:24:39.615
<v John Miller>of this project.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/514-0
00:24:40.415 --> 00:24:47.506
<v John Miller>And create an AI folder and create
optimized versions of all of these and so</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/514-1
00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:48.335
<v John Miller>that way.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/518-0
00:24:50.695 --> 00:24:56.439
<v John Miller>So that way I would have something that I
could use actually for when I was using</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/518-1
00:24:56.439 --> 00:25:01.832
<v John Miller>an AI and some things that I would have
if I was actually trying to do this,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/518-2
00:25:01.832 --> 00:25:05.895
<v John Miller>just to understand the process or
implement it on my own.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/519-0
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:07.455
<v John Miller>Yeah, so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/522-0
00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:15.535
<v John Miller>So I'll stop here and ask for questions.
See if you have any comments on that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/524-0
00:25:15.655 --> 00:25:19.421
<v Majernik, Peter>What kind of app is this?
Is it the web app or is it just REST API</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/528-0
00:25:19.095 --> 00:25:22.015
<v John Miller>Well,
we haven't really got into the business</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/524-1
00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:20.095
<v Majernik, Peter>endpoint or?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/528-1
00:25:22.015 --> 00:25:25.505
<v John Miller>requirements yet.
So this is this is a vertical slice,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/528-2
00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:29.059
<v John Miller>but it would it would be most likely a
web application,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/528-3
00:25:29.059 --> 00:25:33.375
<v John Miller>but the back end processing you know
could be could be implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/529-0
00:25:34.455 --> 00:25:34.535
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/532-0
00:25:34.775 --> 00:25:40.917
<v Majernik, Peter>Actually let me rephrase the question.
Is is the same instruction file</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/532-1
00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:45.935
<v Majernik, Peter>applicable to any app or only for
specific types of apps?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/537-0
00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:50.501
<v John Miller>I think it's applicable to any
implementation that you want to you want</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/537-1
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:54.488
<v John Miller>to do, but but it is it.
It does focus on particular architectural</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/537-2
00:25:54.488 --> 00:25:58.833
<v John Miller>patterns. So if you were to create,
so if you're creating a a monolithic</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/535-0
00:25:54.935 --> 00:25:55.055
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/537-3
00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:02.047
<v John Miller>application,
it'd be much more difficult to implement</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/537-4
00:26:02.047 --> 00:26:03.535
<v John Miller>that in a vertical slice.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/541-0
00:26:04.055 --> 00:26:08.673
<v John Miller>Because of the tight coupling that you
have to deal with when you're actually</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/541-1
00:26:08.673 --> 00:26:13.468
<v John Miller>going to that implementation, you know,
or if you're trying to implement it in a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/541-2
00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:17.612
<v John Miller>in a more of a tiered approach,
you're going to have some of the same</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/541-3
00:26:17.612 --> 00:26:18.855
<v John Miller>challenge challenges.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/545-0
00:26:19.735 --> 00:26:25.494
<v John Miller>But I think any I think by and large you
could apply this to any particular</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/545-1
00:26:25.494 --> 00:26:30.798
<v John Miller>problem domain and and get and be able to
use it to do an application</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/548-0
00:26:30.695 --> 00:26:33.902
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.
And one more question about the CQRS you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/545-2
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:31.935
<v John Miller>implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/548-1
00:26:33.902 --> 00:26:39.818
<v Majernik, Peter>mentioned. I haven't actually used that,
but it is tied to eventual consistency in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/548-2
00:26:39.818 --> 00:26:43.738
<v Majernik, Peter>a way, right?
So it's like if you want to do like CRUD</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/548-3
00:26:43.738 --> 00:26:46.375
<v Majernik, Peter>operations, it's not the right thing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/549-0
00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:47.695
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that correct?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/551-0
00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:51.415
<v John Miller>Oh yeah, it does have.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/556-0
00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:53.890
<v Majernik, Peter>Like when if I worry about like
transactions like database transactions</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/556-1
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.246
<v Majernik, Peter>and getting committed right away.
So in in other words,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/556-2
00:26:57.246 --> 00:27:00.841
<v Majernik, Peter>as soon as I write I should be able to
read the same thing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/556-3
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:04.137
<v Majernik, Peter>This is not the right type of design
pattern for that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/556-4
00:27:04.137 --> 00:27:06.055
<v Majernik, Peter>Is is that a correct assumption?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/558-0
00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:10.755
<v John Miller>Um, I wouldn't.
I would I say that you you have to deal</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/558-1
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:11.375
<v John Miller>with the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/561-0
00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:19.105
<v John Miller>We have to do be able to compensate for
for the for the slight delay that you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/561-1
00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:22.095
<v John Miller>have between when something is processed.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/563-0
00:27:19.815 --> 00:27:23.909
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, OK. So the delay,
that's the eventual consistency.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/563-1
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:25.695
<v Majernik, Peter>That's what I meant. OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/566-0
00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:28.441
<v John Miller>Right.
But I would like I said you know if if if</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/566-1
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:34.375
<v John Miller>the implementation is is you know
performance then that that delay is gonna</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/566-2
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:36.015
<v John Miller>be very very minimal.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/572-0
00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:43.505
<v John Miller>Right. And from a transaction perspective,
I think there's some benefits to this in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/567-0
00:27:38.655 --> 00:27:38.895
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/572-1
00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:49.839
<v John Miller>the sense that since you're processing a
command in a in a largely decoupled event</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/572-2
00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:53.730
<v John Miller>driven way,
if there's a problem with implementing</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/572-3
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.935
<v John Miller>that that command because of some sort of.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/577-0
00:27:57.015 --> 00:28:01.872
<v John Miller>Of lock or block on the database.
You can just basically put that back in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/577-1
00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:07.188
<v John Miller>the queue and try it later and you don't
have to necessarily go back and you get</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/577-2
00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:11.454
<v John Miller>some flexibility there.
I think that you don't have if you're if</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/575-0
00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:09.455
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, yeah, OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/577-3
00:28:11.454 --> 00:28:14.735
<v John Miller>you're immediately trying to update the
database.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/580-0
00:28:15.095 --> 00:28:19.148
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, and just one more question I have.
It's totally unrelated.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/580-1
00:28:19.148 --> 00:28:24.135
<v Majernik, Peter>Do you ever write code from scratch or do
you write all your code with prompts?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/583-0
00:28:21.975 --> 00:28:28.296
<v John Miller>Well, it's a combination of both,
particularly when I'm working on,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/583-1
00:28:28.296 --> 00:28:35.081
<v John Miller>you know, actual applications.
What I'm going to show you today is going</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/583-2
00:28:35.081 --> 00:28:38.055
<v John Miller>to be largely done with with AI.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/588-0
00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:44.385
<v John Miller>And I tend to favor the AI simply because
it helps me learn how to use the AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/588-1
00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:48.199
<v John Miller>better.
And this is the kind of what I'm gonna</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/588-2
00:28:48.199 --> 00:28:55.016
<v John Miller>show you today is a bit of an experiment.
I've finished the second iteration of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/588-3
00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:57.775
<v John Miller>experiment and I'm working on 1/3.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/592-0
00:28:58.095 --> 00:29:01.361
<v John Miller>Iteration,
which I'll talk about that adds</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/592-1
00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:06.375
<v John Miller>improvements into the process,
modifies the instruction files and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/592-2
00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:12.072
<v John Miller>improves the with the idea of trying to
make it more efficient and make it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/592-3
00:29:12.072 --> 00:29:13.895
<v John Miller>produce better outcomes.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/593-0
00:29:14.775 --> 00:29:17.215
<v John Miller>Um, uh and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/600-0
00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:22.156
<v John Miller>So, but anyway,
so I to answer your question, I I do both.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/600-1
00:29:22.156 --> 00:29:25.250
<v John Miller>It just depends on you know what the code
looks like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/600-2
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.432
<v John Miller>But even if I'm writing the code by hand,
I'm I'm still using AI to make</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/600-3
00:29:29.432 --> 00:29:33.787
<v John Miller>suggestions in terms of what what the
issue are or help understand what the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/600-4
00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:37.855
<v John Miller>code is doing or for that or the like.
But I I use the AI quite a bit.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/599-0
00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:40.015
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thank you.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/602-0
00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:46.335
<v John Miller>OK, so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/607-0
00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:52.620
<v John Miller>So there was 2 aspects that I I kind of
added to this yesterday.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/607-1
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.043
<v John Miller>One was the the vertical slice
implementation and the the second one I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/607-2
00:29:58.043 --> 00:30:04.382
<v John Miller>added was how to turn business rules into
slices and I'll I'll show you that a bit</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/607-3
00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:07.055
<v John Miller>later, but I wanted to kind of get.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/609-0
00:30:07.095 --> 00:30:13.095
<v John Miller>Get What I wanted to talk about was
optimizing our.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/614-0
00:30:14.615 --> 00:30:19.978
<v John Miller>Are our instructions strictly for A I?
If we if we do a comparison,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/614-1
00:30:19.978 --> 00:30:25.814
<v John Miller>say select this for comparison,
this is the vertical slice implementation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/614-2
00:30:25.814 --> 00:30:31.335
<v John Miller>instructions with the A I vertical slice
implementation instructions.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/618-0
00:30:36.295 --> 00:30:41.609
<v John Miller>You'll see that it made a substantial
amount of changes to the file to optimize</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/618-1
00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:46.924
<v John Miller>it for AI, and I actually had a prompt.
I don't know if I could find it for the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/618-2
00:30:46.924 --> 00:30:47.455
<v John Miller>history.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/623-0
00:30:58.415 --> 00:30:58.575
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/625-0
00:31:01.655 --> 00:31:04.575
<v John Miller>I'm not seeing seeing what I was looking
for.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/632-0
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:12.309
<v John Miller>Anyway,
what the the prompt did was basically</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/632-1
00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:16.902
<v John Miller>instead of doing a a character by
character comparison between the two,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/632-2
00:31:16.902 --> 00:31:21.303
<v John Miller>which is difficult to understand,
I just asked it to do a comparison</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/632-3
00:31:21.303 --> 00:31:25.895
<v John Miller>between the these two files and show me
what the actual difference was.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/637-0
00:31:25.895 --> 00:31:32.920
<v John Miller>With a significant difference and that
produces a much cleaner analysis of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/637-1
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.545
<v John Miller>difference.
And I got it and it basically said that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/637-2
00:31:37.545 --> 00:31:44.392
<v John Miller>the original ones I created since I did
not specify this is really should be</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/637-3
00:31:44.392 --> 00:31:45.815
<v John Miller>targeted for AI.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/642-0
00:31:45.935 --> 00:31:51.164
<v John Miller>Implementation and it should be optimized
for reducing the number of tokens</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/642-1
00:31:51.164 --> 00:31:56.186
<v John Miller>required to implement or to take
advantage of that instruction file that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/642-2
00:31:56.186 --> 00:32:01.140
<v John Miller>this one that the human readable more
human readable one of the is more</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/642-3
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.855
<v John Miller>conceptual in nature in terms of actually
describing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/644-0
00:32:05.655 --> 00:32:10.042
<v John Miller>The process where the the one that was
created specifically AI is much more</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/644-1
00:32:10.042 --> 00:32:14.775
<v John Miller>implementation focused in terms of how to
actually create those individual files.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/647-0
00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:21.497
<v John Miller>And I'll get into a little bit more depth
with these later,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/647-1
00:32:21.497 --> 00:32:24.895
<v John Miller>but I kind of want to go back now to the
slides.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/653-0
00:32:29.495 --> 00:32:34.308
<v John Miller>So what we're going to talk about today
is what what I refer to as an A I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/653-1
00:32:34.308 --> 00:32:37.299
<v John Miller>assisted workflow for Greenfield
development.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/653-2
00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:41.397
<v John Miller>We'll talk about what project
requirements are, what they are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/653-3
00:32:41.397 --> 00:32:46.600
<v John Miller>I'm using a conceptual model here because
it provides a couple of benefits that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/653-4
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.575
<v John Miller>I'll point out.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/657-0
00:32:47.815 --> 00:32:52.592
<v John Miller>And what workflows are implemented.
So I'm trying to say this is the project</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/657-1
00:32:52.592 --> 00:32:55.880
<v John Miller>requirements.
I don't want to focus a lot of time on</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/657-2
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.540
<v John Miller>the particular model or the that I'm
using to notate them,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/657-3
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.455
<v John Miller>but say that we want to define what those
are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/662-0
00:33:03.015 --> 00:33:07.061
<v John Miller>Then we're going to create instruction
files for that project,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/662-1
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:12.390
<v John Miller>which we've done so much somewhat already,
but we can actually improve on that and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/662-2
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.730
<v John Miller>then do something called an
implementation prompts.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/662-3
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:20.674
<v John Miller>So this what this does is it looks the
idea here would be it would look at a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/662-4
00:33:20.674 --> 00:33:22.215
<v John Miller>vertical slice and then.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/667-0
00:33:22.415 --> 00:33:26.532
<v John Miller>And then create implementation prompts
that would actually allow us to go</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/667-1
00:33:26.532 --> 00:33:30.816
<v John Miller>through and implement that feature.
I've used this in both with the vertical</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/667-2
00:33:30.816 --> 00:33:35.434
<v John Miller>slice architecture or implementation as
well as just a standard tier architecture.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/667-3
00:33:35.434 --> 00:33:39.551
<v John Miller>I'll go through and show you some
examples of what those look like and we</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/667-4
00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:42.055
<v John Miller>can go on then I'll just talk at the end
of.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/670-0
00:33:42.095 --> 00:33:45.539
<v John Miller>A course about lessons learned,
what's coming,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/670-1
00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:51.473
<v John Miller>what I'm what I'm coming down the Pike
with in terms of and some tips and tricks</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/670-2
00:33:51.473 --> 00:33:56.895
<v John Miller>to which are kind of just random things
that I think it's helping me out.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/675-0
00:33:57.855 --> 00:34:02.641
<v John Miller>So in this in in this part of the course,
we're going to continue to use this AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/675-1
00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:07.486
<v John Miller>assisted software development one that I
just showed you that has all the prompts</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/675-2
00:34:07.486 --> 00:34:11.799
<v John Miller>and all the instruction files that I've
created so far that we can take,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/675-3
00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:13.335
<v John Miller>you can take advantage of.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/681-0
00:34:14.055 --> 00:34:19.184
<v John Miller>There's a Zeus academia.
2 which is the the second version of this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/681-1
00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:25.461
<v John Miller>of this academia problem domain that I'm
working with and the idea that I that as</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/681-2
00:34:25.461 --> 00:34:31.815
<v John Miller>I go through one iteration to the next I
use the same exact business requirements.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/683-0
00:34:32.015 --> 00:34:34.901
<v John Miller>So I'm not changing those.
The only thing I'm changing is how it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/683-1
00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:35.655
<v John Miller>gets implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/688-0
00:34:39.695 --> 00:34:44.322
<v John Miller>And we'll get into that.
So here's this high-level workflow.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/688-1
00:34:44.322 --> 00:34:49.859
<v John Miller>So the idea is that we start with a
definition of business requirements.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/688-2
00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:55.471
<v John Miller>The business requirements are obviously a
key to the implementations of a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/688-3
00:34:55.471 --> 00:34:59.415
<v John Miller>Greenfield app and be able to define
those well up.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/693-0
00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:06.859
<v John Miller>Front as much as we can and then proceed
to use those business requirements to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/693-1
00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:12.577
<v John Miller>drive out the rest of the implementation
of the application.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/693-2
00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:18.575
<v John Miller>So in this process the stakeholders
define the requirements so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/697-0
00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:23.576
<v John Miller>In lieu of stakeholders actually telling
us what the application needs to do,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/697-1
00:35:23.576 --> 00:35:28.144
<v John Miller>what I've done is I've picked up an
existing problem domain which has an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/697-2
00:35:28.144 --> 00:35:33.024
<v John Miller>existing conceptual model that we can use
that will allow us to say that, OK,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/697-3
00:35:33.024 --> 00:35:33.775
<v John Miller>this is the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/701-0
00:35:33.775 --> 00:35:37.267
<v John Miller>Requirements that these have been
validated by the stakeholders.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/701-1
00:35:37.267 --> 00:35:41.458
<v John Miller>This is what we would need to implement
and it'll kind of jumpstart the whole</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/701-2
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:43.929
<v John Miller>process.
We won't have to spend a lot of time</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/701-3
00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:48.012
<v John Miller>debating what the requirements are
because they're kind of already packaged</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/701-4
00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:50.215
<v John Miller>up and ready for us to take advantage of.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/705-0
00:35:50.655 --> 00:35:55.252
<v John Miller>So then the AI transfers those
requirements into implementation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/705-1
00:35:55.252 --> 00:35:59.059
<v John Miller>instructions.
So what this would do is start to turn</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/705-2
00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:04.589
<v John Miller>those into instructions that the app that
the implementation can use when it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/705-3
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:07.175
<v John Miller>actually wants to start to generate.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/709-0
00:36:08.055 --> 00:36:11.971
<v John Miller>Pieces of the app.
So in this process the stakeholders and I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/709-1
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:17.363
<v John Miller>would include in the stakeholders the the
technology side of things because they're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/709-2
00:36:17.363 --> 00:36:21.343
<v John Miller>all stakeholders as well.
So everybody would review these and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/709-3
00:36:21.343 --> 00:36:23.975
<v John Miller>improve and approve them or improve them.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/714-0
00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:29.028
<v John Miller>To the point where everyone's satisfied
that we have the correct requirements.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/714-1
00:36:29.028 --> 00:36:33.700
<v John Miller>Then the AI uses the instructions to
create an importer implementation prompts,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/714-2
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.313
<v John Miller>and those actually are the things that
say you need to implement these things,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/714-3
00:36:38.313 --> 00:36:42.575
<v John Miller>and then the stakeovers review and
improve those implementation prompts.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/718-0
00:36:43.055 --> 00:36:46.272
<v John Miller>And because they're largely in natural
language,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/718-1
00:36:46.272 --> 00:36:50.343
<v John Miller>we can it's easier for us to discuss
those and approve those.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/718-2
00:36:50.343 --> 00:36:55.726
<v John Miller>Then it uses those implementation prompts
and the implementations instructions to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/718-3
00:36:55.726 --> 00:36:58.615
<v John Miller>actually implement a implement to
solution.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/720-0
00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:04.311
<v John Miller>And then we can obviously review and
approve approve that implementation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/720-1
00:37:04.311 --> 00:37:06.055
<v John Miller>questions on this process.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/723-0
00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:13.463
<v John Miller>So it's not as if we just say go,
you know, start out and write code.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/723-1
00:37:13.463 --> 00:37:16.375
<v John Miller>We want to make this a a a structured
approach.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/724-0
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:19.015
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/729-0
00:37:20.415 --> 00:37:23.299
<v John Miller>Yeah,
and it's something that is reviewed along</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/729-1
00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:27.445
<v John Miller>the way to make sure that it's correct.
So, so project requirements,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/729-2
00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.389
<v John Miller>those are things like business rules,
workflows,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/729-3
00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:34.835
<v John Miller>the the text stack that you need to
implement it in the architecture that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/729-4
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:35.255
<v John Miller>you're.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/731-0
00:37:36.015 --> 00:37:40.705
<v John Miller>Intending to use are all things that we
wanna basically create instruction files</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/731-1
00:37:40.705 --> 00:37:44.295
<v John Miller>that says this is how you need to
implement this application.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/735-0
00:37:49.335 --> 00:37:55.358
<v John Miller>So that's kind of the same thing.
Project requirements are business rules,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/735-1
00:37:55.358 --> 00:38:00.095
<v John Miller>workflows and the architecture. All right,
so this is the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/740-0
00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:09.282
<v John Miller>A diagram which it's a a conceptual model
of an academia domain. So it has a whoops,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/740-1
00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:13.951
<v John Miller>sorry.
So the way you can understand this model</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/740-2
00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:15.215
<v John Miller>is that it's.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/744-0
00:38:16.495 --> 00:38:20.190
<v John Miller>Conceptual.
So it has no tied or it's technology</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/744-1
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.206
<v John Miller>agnostic,
which means it's suitable for</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/744-2
00:38:23.206 --> 00:38:28.785
<v John Miller>implementing in any technology.
You can you can project this model into a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/744-3
00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:32.932
<v John Miller>database structure.
You can project it into a a class,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/744-4
00:38:32.932 --> 00:38:33.535
<v John Miller>a class.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/748-0
00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:37.018
<v John Miller>Structure.
You can project it into a how a user</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/748-1
00:38:37.018 --> 00:38:41.589
<v John Miller>interface might be put together.
So that's a real interesting.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/748-2
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:47.030
<v John Miller>I just want to point out a couple of
things about it is that it has a very</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/748-3
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.295
<v John Miller>rich constraint language which allows us
to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/752-0
00:38:50.415 --> 00:38:55.525
<v John Miller>Be very precise about our the the
business rules that we want to enforce</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/752-1
00:38:55.525 --> 00:39:00.215
<v John Miller>within this application.
So we have an academic here and it's this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/752-2
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:05.115
<v John Miller>is called a reference mode.
So it's referred to by an employee number</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/752-3
00:39:05.115 --> 00:39:06.095
<v John Miller>that academic.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/757-0
00:39:06.615 --> 00:39:12.198
<v John Miller>Is contracted until the date, right.
So that's a this is referred to as a a a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/757-1
00:39:12.198 --> 00:39:18.138
<v John Miller>predicate or a fact that we that we want
that we have an interest in recording you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/757-2
00:39:18.138 --> 00:39:22.647
<v John Miller>know that data on it.
There's a little bar here that indicates</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/757-3
00:39:22.647 --> 00:39:25.295
<v John Miller>that this part of the this predicate.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/762-0
00:39:25.775 --> 00:39:31.444
<v John Miller>Is is unique.
That means each academic is contracted</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/762-1
00:39:31.444 --> 00:39:37.006
<v John Miller>until until a date,
but from the dates perspective,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/762-2
00:39:37.006 --> 00:39:45.135
<v John Miller>the date the multiple academics can be
can be contracted to that same date.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/763-0
00:39:46.695 --> 00:39:48.295
<v John Miller>Does that make sense?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/765-0
00:39:51.095 --> 00:39:52.335
<v Majernik, Peter>Yes, yes.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-0
00:39:51.615 --> 00:39:54.221
<v John Miller>OK, all right.
So then we have another fact.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/766-0
00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:53.975
<v Majernik, Peter>They.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-1
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:57.580
<v John Miller>This is a unary fact.
So there's this basically says that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-2
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.996
<v John Miller>academic either plays this role or
doesn't play this role.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-3
00:40:00.996 --> 00:40:04.181
<v John Miller>And so then here we're saying the
academic is tenured.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-4
00:40:04.181 --> 00:40:07.424
<v John Miller>And then this is what's called an
exclusion constraint.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/772-5
00:40:07.424 --> 00:40:11.535
<v John Miller>And the exclusion constraint means that
if it's attached to this part.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/775-0
00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:17.890
<v John Miller>This role and this role that the academic
can't play both roles at the same time.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/775-1
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:23.517
<v John Miller>So from a verbalization perspective,
the academic is either tenured or is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/775-2
00:40:23.517 --> 00:40:27.775
<v John Miller>contracted until the date in this
exclusion constraint.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/780-0
00:40:28.255 --> 00:40:34.546
<v John Miller>Implied that this needs to be implemented
in the application and respected so that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/780-1
00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:39.093
<v John Miller>this is never the case.
So that if you have somebody that's</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/780-2
00:40:39.093 --> 00:40:43.792
<v John Miller>contracted in a date and you go to a
process that is tenured,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/780-3
00:40:43.792 --> 00:40:45.535
<v John Miller>then you you no longer.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/781-0
00:40:45.815 --> 00:40:50.455
<v John Miller>Need to want to preserve that date of
contractors is no longer relevant.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/783-0
00:40:52.415 --> 00:40:54.455
<v John Miller>Any questions on that kind of constraint?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/785-0
00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:58.768
<v John Miller>Alright,
so let me talk about a couple other ones.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/785-1
00:40:58.768 --> 00:40:58.935
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/791-0
00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:06.502
<v John Miller>So here is inheritance.
So we're looking at an academic who is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/791-1
00:41:06.502 --> 00:41:12.239
<v John Miller>either a professor or a teacher,
or if or a teaching professor,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/791-2
00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:17.528
<v John Miller>which is both an academic,
both a professor and a teacher.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/791-3
00:41:17.528 --> 00:41:20.575
<v John Miller>So this is a multiple inheritance.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/794-0
00:41:20.575 --> 00:41:26.324
<v John Miller>Implied in the model or subtyping.
And the idea here is that if you're a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/794-1
00:41:26.324 --> 00:41:30.419
<v John Miller>professor,
you all of these facts that are directly</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/794-2
00:41:30.419 --> 00:41:35.695
<v John Miller>tied to the professor are in play.
If you're a teacher, then this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/799-0
00:41:35.695 --> 00:41:39.023
<v John Miller>Fact is in play,
and if you're a teaching professor,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/799-1
00:41:39.023 --> 00:41:43.293
<v John Miller>then this fact comes into play.
And so the the application needs to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/799-2
00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:48.190
<v John Miller>understand the difference between a
teacher and a professor and what the what</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/799-3
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:51.581
<v John Miller>the rules are,
the business rules that are applied to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/799-4
00:41:51.581 --> 00:41:51.895
<v John Miller>each.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/803-0
00:41:52.095 --> 00:41:57.566
<v John Miller>And here we have a a a couple of roles
that kind of span the subtype where you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/803-1
00:41:57.566 --> 00:42:00.821
<v John Miller>say an academic works for a department,
right?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/803-2
00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:06.500
<v John Miller>And they work for a single department and
the little dot means it's required that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/803-3
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.855
<v John Miller>an academic work for a department.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/807-0
00:42:09.415 --> 00:42:14.390
<v John Miller>And then we have a that our professor
actually heads a department.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/807-1
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:20.108
<v John Miller>And what's interesting about this is that
this is a full spanning uniqueness</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/807-2
00:42:20.108 --> 00:42:24.415
<v John Miller>constraint to it's that the professor can
work, can head.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/811-0
00:42:24.415 --> 00:42:30.388
<v John Miller>One or more departments and a department
can be headed by more than one professor.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/811-1
00:42:30.388 --> 00:42:36.217
<v John Miller>And we have a constraint here that says
that a professor that heads a department</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/811-2
00:42:36.217 --> 00:42:39.095
<v John Miller>also must work for that same department.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/812-0
00:42:41.495 --> 00:42:42.535
<v John Miller>Does that make sense?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/817-0
00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:48.663
<v John Miller>All right,
so the last thing I want to talk about is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/817-1
00:42:48.663 --> 00:42:52.625
<v John Miller>a teacher here,
and it says the teacher is audited by</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/817-2
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:57.027
<v John Miller>another teacher.
So this is what's referred to as a a ring,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/817-3
00:42:57.027 --> 00:43:00.621
<v John Miller>and it's a.
So it's where the teacher plays both</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/817-4
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:02.015
<v John Miller>roles in this fact.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/818-0
00:43:02.335 --> 00:43:02.415
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/823-0
00:43:04.655 --> 00:43:10.138
<v John Miller>And the uniqueness constraints of that a
teacher audits is audit.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/823-1
00:43:10.138 --> 00:43:17.034
<v John Miller>A teacher is audited by multiple teachers,
but a teacher audits multiple teachers,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/823-2
00:43:17.034 --> 00:43:20.855
<v John Miller>but a teacher is audited by a single
teacher.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/828-0
00:43:21.135 --> 00:43:25.424
<v John Miller>And this is a ring constraint,
which is an irreflexive reach constraint</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/828-1
00:43:25.424 --> 00:43:28.938
<v John Miller>that says that if a teacher is audited by
another teacher,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/828-2
00:43:28.938 --> 00:43:32.929
<v John Miller>it can't be the same teacher.
So a teacher can't audit themselves.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/828-3
00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:37.575
<v John Miller>So there's just a couple of things.
Lots of different other constraints here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/828-4
00:43:37.575 --> 00:43:40.255
<v John Miller>Here's a constraint that describes what
the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/832-0
00:43:40.815 --> 00:43:44.942
<v John Miller>A lot of values are for that particular
role.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/832-1
00:43:44.942 --> 00:43:50.146
<v John Miller>Here we're specifying specifically what
those values are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/832-2
00:43:50.146 --> 00:43:56.068
<v John Miller>Lots of different richness,
and I'll talk about some of that in a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/832-3
00:43:56.068 --> 00:43:57.055
<v John Miller>little bit.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/836-0
00:43:57.135 --> 00:44:00.215
<v John Miller>So as I said,
it's technology agnostic and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/836-1
00:44:00.215 --> 00:44:04.942
<v John Miller>transformable into logical models that we
can actually implement.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/836-2
00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:10.600
<v John Miller>And one thing I've liked about this kind
of notation is very clear in terms of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/836-3
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.175
<v John Miller>what you're trying to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/842-0
00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:16.761
<v John Miller>Specify. It's very expressive.
It's actually based on predicate logic,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/842-1
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:20.411
<v John Miller>so there's actually a formality to it
that underpins it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/842-2
00:44:20.411 --> 00:44:25.148
<v John Miller>It's not just a lines and boxes.
And but I just wanted to point out these</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/842-3
00:44:25.148 --> 00:44:30.143
<v John Miller>kinds of models are not a requirement for
we're doing Greenfield development.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/842-4
00:44:30.143 --> 00:44:31.615
<v John Miller>I'm just using it as I.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/846-0
00:44:31.975 --> 00:44:37.154
<v John Miller>A way of short cutting the process to get
to actual implementation,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/846-1
00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:43.552
<v John Miller>but I do do really think that these kinds
of conceptual models are really add a lot</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/846-2
00:44:43.552 --> 00:44:47.055
<v John Miller>of value into a the design of an
application.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/850-0
00:44:48.695 --> 00:44:52.410
<v John Miller>All right then.
So then specifically optical models,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/850-1
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:56.266
<v John Miller>which is the one I show is a type of
conceptual model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/850-2
00:44:56.266 --> 00:45:00.682
<v John Miller>It's supported in Visual Studio via an
extension called Norma.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/850-3
00:45:00.682 --> 00:45:02.855
<v John Miller>I probably could show you that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/852-0
00:45:05.535 --> 00:45:07.775
<v John Miller>And did I have it open?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/858-0
00:45:09.975 --> 00:45:15.224
<v John Miller>No, I'll show it to you in a minute.
And what's I think another interesting</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/858-1
00:45:15.224 --> 00:45:19.299
<v John Miller>aspect of these or models that they're
textual and visual.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/858-2
00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:24.755
<v John Miller>So the text can be visualized and the
which means you can turn the text into a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/858-3
00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:29.175
<v John Miller>diagram or the diagrams can be verbalized,
which means you can.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/861-0
00:45:29.575 --> 00:45:35.512
<v John Miller>Take the diagram or a piece of the
diagram and turn it into into text.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/861-1
00:45:35.512 --> 00:45:41.783
<v John Miller>This dual nature of the model makes it
really suitable for validating with</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/861-2
00:45:41.783 --> 00:45:44.375
<v John Miller>subject matter experts because.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/866-0
00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:47.852
<v John Miller>When you when you show them the diagram,
which is,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/866-1
00:45:47.852 --> 00:45:52.543
<v John Miller>I'm sure the same impression that you got
of it out of it was that it's very it's</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/866-2
00:45:52.543 --> 00:45:57.062
<v John Miller>just very difficult to understand at
first glance what it's trying to express.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/866-3
00:45:57.062 --> 00:46:01.295
<v John Miller>But if you can turn it into text,
that's something that you can actually.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/869-0
00:46:01.495 --> 00:46:05.950
<v John Miller>Validate with the subject matter expert
and they can tell you whether those</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/869-1
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.757
<v John Miller>constraints that you we've diagrammed are
actually valid in the in the context of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/869-2
00:46:10.757 --> 00:46:11.695
<v John Miller>the application.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/874-0
00:46:13.655 --> 00:46:19.250
<v John Miller>All right, so Academia 2 is based on.
It's based on a publicly available model</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/874-1
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.136
<v John Miller>of a commonly understood domain.
So this kind of allows us to think,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/874-2
00:46:24.136 --> 00:46:29.872
<v John Miller>not think about the the problem domain
because we kind of know what teachers and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/874-3
00:46:29.872 --> 00:46:32.775
<v John Miller>professors and academia model looks like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/878-0
00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:36.836
<v John Miller>If you if you're interested in how this
model was actually created,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/878-1
00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:41.311
<v John Miller>this white paper actually walks you
through the whole process, starting with,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/878-2
00:46:41.311 --> 00:46:44.295
<v John Miller>you know,
a blank page and what are the what is the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/878-3
00:46:44.295 --> 00:46:48.655
<v John Miller>kind of analysis that you need to do in
order to produce a a a valid model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/882-0
00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:51.948
<v John Miller>But it allows us quickly to to move,
you know,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/882-1
00:46:51.948 --> 00:46:56.440
<v John Miller>from for the for the purposes of this
course to quickly move beyond the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/882-2
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.997
<v John Miller>requirements and into implementation.
And why is it too?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/882-3
00:46:59.997 --> 00:47:03.803
<v John Miller>Because it's the second iteration.
The third is in planning.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/882-4
00:47:03.803 --> 00:47:06.735
<v John Miller>I can kind of show you the beginnings of
that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/887-0
00:47:07.015 --> 00:47:11.768
<v John Miller>And one thing I'd like to to to to
express is that it's kind of an agile</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/887-1
00:47:11.768 --> 00:47:15.414
<v John Miller>development philosophy that if something
is hard to do,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/887-2
00:47:15.414 --> 00:47:19.581
<v John Miller>you want to do it more often.
So I'm trying to iterate this as,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/887-3
00:47:19.581 --> 00:47:22.967
<v John Miller>you know,
often as I can in order to try to improve</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/887-4
00:47:22.967 --> 00:47:24.855
<v John Miller>the process as much as I can.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/890-0
00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:29.867
<v John Miller>Now of course this is not the only way
that you can you do a greenfield</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/890-1
00:47:29.867 --> 00:47:33.174
<v John Miller>development,
but what I think is kind of interesting</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/890-2
00:47:33.174 --> 00:47:38.415
<v John Miller>about this is that it it it really allows
us to lean heavily on the A I to help us.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/895-0
00:47:40.935 --> 00:47:48.223
<v John Miller>The other side of things that ARM doesn't
really capture well is the the use cases</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/895-1
00:47:48.223 --> 00:47:55.071
<v John Miller>or the processes that that you need to
implement in order to actually have an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/895-2
00:47:55.071 --> 00:47:58.495
<v John Miller>application that actually do something.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/900-0
00:47:59.015 --> 00:48:04.280
<v John Miller>And so examples of that would be to
promote a lecturer to a senior lecturer,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/900-1
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.246
<v John Miller>promote a senior lecturer to an associate
professor, etc.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/900-2
00:48:08.246 --> 00:48:12.553
<v John Miller>These are all use cases that we would
want to see implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/900-3
00:48:12.553 --> 00:48:18.160
<v John Miller>We would want to actually describe what
those use cases are and be detailed about</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/900-4
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.775
<v John Miller>what our.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/903-0
00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:23.543
<v John Miller>Expectations are so that when we ask AI
to help us implement it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/903-1
00:48:23.543 --> 00:48:28.015
<v John Miller>it has a better sense for what the what
our expectations are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/904-0
00:48:29.335 --> 00:48:32.495
<v John Miller>I'm sure you're all familiar with use
cases, so at least half of us your.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/907-0
00:48:34.615 --> 00:48:39.615
<v John Miller>So let's talk about, you know,
creating project instructions.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/909-0
00:48:41.855 --> 00:48:45.095
<v John Miller>Alright, so let's do this.
How can I get to this?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/918-0
00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:09.935
<v John Miller>What I'm going to do is open U Visual
Studio and I'll show you the the model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/947-0
00:50:19.575 --> 00:50:19.655
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/949-0
00:50:23.935 --> 00:50:26.015
<v John Miller>Where is my model?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/966-0
00:51:01.215 --> 00:51:04.935
<v John Miller>Here we go.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/973-0
00:51:22.215 --> 00:51:26.375
<v John Miller>Models. Here we go. And here's our model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/977-0
00:51:29.215 --> 00:51:33.146
<v John Miller>And I have that extension installed so we
can actually work with this model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/977-1
00:51:33.146 --> 00:51:36.975
<v John Miller>Here's you can see it's the same thing
that I was showing you on the side.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/979-0
00:51:38.775 --> 00:51:44.347
<v John Miller>But what the the only reason I came over
here is I wanted to show you the the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/979-1
00:51:44.347 --> 00:51:46.775
<v John Miller>verbalization piece. So let me um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/982-0
00:51:52.495 --> 00:51:54.495
<v John Miller>Choose the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/985-0
00:51:55.735 --> 00:52:01.744
<v John Miller>Orm tools and these are some of the tools
you can use to build the model,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/985-1
00:52:01.744 --> 00:52:03.855
<v John Miller>but I want the verbalizer.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/987-0
00:52:10.575 --> 00:52:11.615
<v John Miller>O with this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/989-0
00:52:12.615 --> 00:52:14.495
<v John Miller>I can say show me.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/994-0
00:52:16.295 --> 00:52:21.464
<v John Miller>A verbalization of just the room number
and see what it does.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/994-1
00:52:21.464 --> 00:52:27.467
<v John Miller>So a room number is a value type.
It's a decimal. It has a room number,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/994-2
00:52:27.467 --> 00:52:32.387
<v John Miller>some example data.
So what's interesting about the example</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/994-3
00:52:32.387 --> 00:52:36.055
<v John Miller>data is it's actually used to validate
the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/999-0
00:52:36.215 --> 00:52:39.210
<v John Miller>Model.
So if you create a something in the model</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/999-1
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.367
<v John Miller>that doesn't match that and so each exact
room has one room number.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/999-2
00:52:43.367 --> 00:52:48.379
<v John Miller>It's possible that more than one room has
that same room number for each building</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/999-3
00:52:48.379 --> 00:52:53.575
<v John Miller>and room number and much more one room is
in that building and has that room number.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1003-0
00:52:54.295 --> 00:52:59.096
<v John Miller>So this association with building and
room number provides a a preferred</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1003-1
00:52:59.096 --> 00:53:03.830
<v John Miller>identification scheme for a room.
So to know precisely what room you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1003-2
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:08.828
<v John Miller>you're you're referring to in the
universe of that we're that we're talking</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1003-3
00:53:08.828 --> 00:53:10.735
<v John Miller>about here, you need to know.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1006-0
00:53:11.015 --> 00:53:16.216
<v John Miller>What building it's in as well as the the
room number and this is essentially a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1006-1
00:53:16.216 --> 00:53:21.615
<v John Miller>derived uniqueness key and the idea is
that you can select anything in the model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1011-0
00:53:24.095 --> 00:53:30.314
<v John Miller>And it will then verbalize all of that.
And the benefit that I I saw with this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1011-1
00:53:30.314 --> 00:53:36.848
<v John Miller>was that this is something I can give to
an A an A I and it can start to make some</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1011-2
00:53:36.848 --> 00:53:41.335
<v John Miller>sense out of this or in terms of
understanding what the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1013-0
00:53:41.415 --> 00:53:45.135
<v John Miller>What the business rules are for this
particular domain?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1016-0
00:53:47.095 --> 00:53:52.263
<v John Miller>All right, so anyway,
so this is I think interesting and I and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1016-1
00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:58.415
<v John Miller>in terms of what we wanted to look at for
it, let me bring up the project.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1019-0
00:54:07.335 --> 00:54:07.575
<v John Miller>And.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1020-0
00:54:08.055 --> 00:54:08.175
<v John Miller>And.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1023-0
00:54:14.135 --> 00:54:14.535
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1026-0
00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:26.236
<v John Miller>So here in our model models forwarder is
that same arm diagram and the picture of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1026-1
00:54:26.236 --> 00:54:26.535
<v John Miller>it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1027-0
00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:29.375
<v John Miller>And.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1029-0
00:54:31.015 --> 00:54:33.055
<v John Miller>Here is the uh the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1034-0
00:54:34.175 --> 00:54:40.313
<v John Miller>The bit what I'm referring to as the
business rules and here is the facts and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1034-1
00:54:40.313 --> 00:54:46.215
<v John Miller>constraints which are the verbalization
of all of the rules in that model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1036-0
00:54:50.695 --> 00:54:52.415
<v John Miller>As well as.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1040-0
00:54:55.055 --> 00:55:01.184
<v John Miller>At the bottom are some workflows or use
cases that that we want to make sure that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1040-1
00:55:01.184 --> 00:55:06.117
<v John Miller>the application implements.
So this is like the the core document</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1040-2
00:55:06.117 --> 00:55:10.975
<v John Miller>that's going to drive that we're going to
use to make sure that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1044-0
00:55:10.975 --> 00:55:16.193
<v John Miller>The application actually does enforce all
of the business rules that we've</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1044-1
00:55:16.193 --> 00:55:21.966
<v John Miller>described here and can implement all of
the workflows that we've actually defined.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1044-2
00:55:21.966 --> 00:55:23.775
<v John Miller>Any any questions on this?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1049-0
00:55:26.575 --> 00:55:30.970
<v John Miller>So the idea here is that we this becomes
a a key,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1049-1
00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:38.178
<v John Miller>a key document that we can then start to
use to produce other artifacts from this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1049-2
00:55:38.178 --> 00:55:41.255
<v John Miller>that then conform to to to to that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1051-0
00:55:45.615 --> 00:55:48.655
<v John Miller>So what I did in this model then is I
have a a prompt.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1055-0
00:55:52.695 --> 00:55:58.232
<v John Miller>Which is the generated instructions
prompt.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1055-1
00:55:58.232 --> 00:56:03.895
<v John Miller>Let me preview this and open it in a
window.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1061-0
00:56:06.855 --> 00:56:11.420
<v John Miller>And what this,
what this one is doing is it wants to say,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1061-1
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.804
<v John Miller>OK,
take these business rules that you and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1061-2
00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:21.337
<v John Miller>create instruction files that will guide
developers in implementing ACQRS academia</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1061-3
00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:26.295
<v John Miller>system that enforces the business rules
in that business rule.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1065-0
00:56:26.415 --> 00:56:30.157
<v John Miller>Each file must be complete,
actionable and production ready.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1065-1
00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:34.880
<v John Miller>It's going to put them in an instructions
generated folder and it's going to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1065-2
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.236
<v John Miller>produce a project overview instruction
that defines the system domain,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1065-3
00:56:39.236 --> 00:56:43.775
<v John Miller>the core entities and their relationships,
the key business and variance.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1070-0
00:56:44.415 --> 00:56:49.806
<v John Miller>The high level architecture overview,
and because we've asked for a CQRS</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1070-1
00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:53.867
<v John Miller>implementation,
invariants are some of the things that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1070-2
00:56:53.867 --> 00:56:59.406
<v John Miller>you want to be able to implement.
Then there's an SDLC process instruction</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1070-3
00:56:59.406 --> 00:57:02.655
<v John Miller>file that defines the development
workflow.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1074-0
00:57:02.975 --> 00:57:08.801
<v John Miller>Specifies the code review requirements,
the definition of done and mandates the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1074-1
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:12.151
<v John Miller>TD approach.
Here we have a git flow workflow</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1074-2
00:57:12.151 --> 00:57:17.395
<v John Miller>instructions that specifies the branch
naming, defines commit messages,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1074-3
00:57:17.395 --> 00:57:19.215
<v John Miller>includes the PR template.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1078-0
00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:24.230
<v John Miller>Here's specific instructions for
implementing a CQRS application.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1078-1
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:28.349
<v John Miller>It will create a architectural design
instruction file,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1078-2
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:33.350
<v John Miller>an Azure infrastructure instruction file,
configuration management,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1078-3
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.175
<v John Miller>testing requirements,
the documentation guidelines.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1082-0
00:57:37.535 --> 00:57:42.359
<v John Miller>Monitoring observability and instructions,
security compliance,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1082-1
00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:47.410
<v John Miller>deployment operations, CIDC pump pipeline,
the AI code governance,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1082-2
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:52.535
<v John Miller>the database migrations instructions,
domain glossary instructions.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1087-0
00:57:53.215 --> 00:57:57.558
<v John Miller>And then it defines what each file should
contain,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1087-1
00:57:57.558 --> 00:58:02.667
<v John Miller>which is a some of a structure in
sections on requirements,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1087-2
00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:08.627
<v John Miller>implementation guidelines, examples,
validation checklists, etcetera.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1087-3
00:58:08.627 --> 00:58:10.415
<v John Miller>So this basically is.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1092-0
00:58:10.615 --> 00:58:16.130
<v John Miller>Is just creating a series of instruction
files that will be used to actually guide</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1092-1
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.784
<v John Miller>the implementation.
So when we ask AI to help us build</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1092-2
00:58:19.784 --> 00:58:24.036
<v John Miller>something in the app,
it will have a better sense of what we're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1092-3
00:58:24.036 --> 00:58:27.025
<v John Miller>asking it to do.
But also important to this,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1092-4
00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:30.015
<v John Miller>each generated file must contain
validation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1095-0
00:58:30.095 --> 00:58:33.797
<v John Miller>Requirements.
So the idea is that you can as you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1095-1
00:58:33.797 --> 00:58:39.493
<v John Miller>going through and implementing pieces of
the application that actually put this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1095-2
00:58:39.493 --> 00:58:43.409
<v John Miller>functionality,
it should have instructions included in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1095-3
00:58:43.409 --> 00:58:44.975
<v John Miller>the instruction files.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1100-0
00:58:45.935 --> 00:58:53.330
<v John Miller>That help you validate that it actually
has created what you expect it to create</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1100-1
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:59.813
<v John Miller>and so and then the final it finishes up
with the output instructions.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1100-2
00:58:59.813 --> 00:59:02.095
<v John Miller>So any questions on this?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1104-0
00:59:04.255 --> 00:59:07.237
<v John Miller>So again,
we're leveraging instruction files as</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1104-1
00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:11.959
<v John Miller>we've done in the past and there's a bit
of overlap to what we from what we</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1104-2
00:59:11.959 --> 00:59:15.935
<v John Miller>created in the legacy side of things and
what we're doing here,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1104-3
00:59:15.935 --> 00:59:18.855
<v John Miller>it's expressed in a slightly different
format.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1109-0
00:59:19.895 --> 00:59:24.740
<v John Miller>What I'm working towards is a
consolidated set of instruction files for</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1109-1
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.643
<v John Miller>different purposes,
because much of what I'm asking it to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1109-2
00:59:28.643 --> 00:59:34.161
<v John Miller>create here would be usable in terms of
the different kinds of instruction files.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1109-3
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:38.535
<v John Miller>So be usable in multiple projects,
the documentation guidelines.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1114-0
00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:42.666
<v John Miller>Shouldn't really change from project to
project, for instance,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1114-1
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:46.532
<v John Miller>so I should be able to create these
instruction files and put them create</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1114-2
00:59:46.532 --> 00:59:50.920
<v John Miller>them once and use them as a repository of
instructions instead of asking to have it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1114-3
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.420
<v John Miller>be generated all the time.
And then this instruction file would go</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1114-4
00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.495
<v John Miller>down to just creating the instruction
files necessary to guide this specific.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1115-0
00:59:58.575 --> 01:00:02.543
<v John Miller>Implementation,
which would be mostly along the project</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1115-1
01:00:02.543 --> 01:00:03.535
<v John Miller>overview side.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1119-0
01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:12.474
<v John Miller>All right. Any questions here? All right,
so let's let's go back to the project</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1119-1
01:00:12.474 --> 01:00:16.133
<v John Miller>then.
And here we see the implementation of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1119-2
01:00:16.133 --> 01:00:16.895
<v John Miller>generated.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1122-0
01:00:18.335 --> 01:00:20.998
<v John Miller>The instruction files for the roject
itself.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1122-1
01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:25.495
<v John Miller>So here we have our roject overview
instructions O this one is going to be.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1124-0
01:00:27.775 --> 01:00:30.535
<v John Miller>Uh, there's our preview.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1129-0
01:00:35.495 --> 01:00:39.786
<v John Miller>So here it provides comprehensive
overview of the application,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1129-1
01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:42.783
<v John Miller>the main entities,
high level architecture.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1129-2
01:00:42.783 --> 01:00:46.392
<v John Miller>So this covers the domain model,
the business rules,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1129-3
01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:50.615
<v John Miller>the entity relationships,
the high level system architecture.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1133-0
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:56.328
<v John Miller>Does not cover implementation specific
details or the schemas or the API</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1133-1
01:00:56.328 --> 01:00:59.970
<v John Miller>specifications.
It's the deployment configurations.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1133-2
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:05.713
<v John Miller>So what we're kind of dealing with here
is a more of a logical model or a logical</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1133-3
01:01:05.713 --> 01:01:09.495
<v John Miller>definition of the application,
but not the specifics.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1135-0
01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:12.215
<v John Miller>Of how it should be implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1140-0
01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:18.996
<v John Miller>The prerequisites are that it's using
domain driven design concepts,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1140-1
01:01:18.996 --> 01:01:22.166
<v John Miller>it's using CQRS and event sourcing
patterns,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1140-2
01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:27.731
<v John Miller>as well as it has the knowledge of the
academic management process and a basic</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1140-3
01:01:27.731 --> 01:01:30.055
<v John Miller>understanding of.net 8 and C# 12.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-0
01:01:30.735 --> 01:01:34.638
<v John Miller>Core business capabilities,
student management, academic,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-1
01:01:34.638 --> 01:01:37.869
<v John Miller>academic program management,
course management,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-2
01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:41.435
<v John Miller>assessment and grading institutional
administration.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-3
01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:47.021
<v John Miller>Then it gets into some of the core domain
entities and how those should be defined</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-4
01:01:47.021 --> 01:01:50.319
<v John Miller>in C#.
It's suggestions what a course would look</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1145-5
01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:50.655
<v John Miller>like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1148-0
01:01:50.855 --> 01:01:57.819
<v John Miller>What an academic program aggregate
aggregate would look like the departments</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1148-1
01:01:57.819 --> 01:02:03.335
<v John Miller>of faculty and the the the the the
student enrollment rules.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1152-0
01:02:05.935 --> 01:02:09.720
<v John Miller>Students and we can see there's a quite a
bit of detail here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1152-1
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.017
<v John Miller>Here's what the entity relationships
would look like,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1152-2
01:02:13.017 --> 01:02:17.963
<v John Miller>what the boundaries of each aggregate are,
the high level architecture that it's</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1152-3
01:02:17.963 --> 01:02:21.015
<v John Miller>looking to try to implement the
technology stack.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1154-0
01:02:21.895 --> 01:02:26.895
<v John Miller>How we would integrate integration
patterns, performance requirements?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1159-0
01:02:29.135 --> 01:02:33.089
<v John Miller>Security considerations,
implementation guidelines for different</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1159-1
01:02:33.089 --> 01:02:35.948
<v John Miller>types of classes.
So here's a command handler,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1159-2
01:02:35.948 --> 01:02:40.389
<v John Miller>what it what it should look like,
what a query handler should look like,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1159-3
01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:43.735
<v John Miller>the cross-cutting concerns in terms of
error handling.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1163-0
01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:49.312
<v John Miller>Correlation ID propagation for monitoring.
It then references other diagram,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1163-1
01:02:49.312 --> 01:02:54.276
<v John Miller>other instruction files as well,
and then it has this validation checklist</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1163-2
01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:58.314
<v John Miller>at the end that says that when all of
these things are done,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1163-3
01:02:58.314 --> 01:03:00.895
<v John Miller>we consider the project to be complete.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1166-0
01:03:07.775 --> 01:03:12.015
<v John Miller>All right. Any questions on on that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1172-0
01:03:13.695 --> 01:03:17.488
<v John Miller>So I'm kind of going through this example
that it's already.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1172-1
01:03:17.488 --> 01:03:21.903
<v John Miller>I've already run through this,
already created an implementation based</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1172-2
01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:25.820
<v John Miller>on on all this and I'll show you that
application in a minute.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1172-3
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.856
<v John Miller>But I want to follow through the process
and kind of illustrate how that process</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1172-4
01:03:30.856 --> 01:03:32.535
<v John Miller>was defined and how to how.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1176-0
01:03:33.295 --> 01:03:37.418
<v John Miller>I used AI to help me build this.
So for instance,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1176-1
01:03:37.418 --> 01:03:41.954
<v John Miller>when it's creating this project over the
instructions,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1176-2
01:03:41.954 --> 01:03:48.221
<v John Miller>it's using that business rules to help us
help it understand what what they</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1176-3
01:03:48.221 --> 01:03:50.695
<v John Miller>actually actually implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1180-0
01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:56.396
<v John Miller>One of the things that I think is
interesting or I was was interesting when</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1180-1
01:03:56.396 --> 01:04:01.602
<v John Miller>I was looking at what it was producing in
terms of the definition of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1180-2
01:04:01.602 --> 01:04:05.453
<v John Miller>application.
I think I can go back down here and show</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1180-3
01:04:05.453 --> 01:04:06.095
<v John Miller>you that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1182-0
01:04:09.895 --> 01:04:13.895
<v John Miller>Where it was. Yeah, it's here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1187-0
01:04:20.015 --> 01:04:27.010
<v John Miller>Is that? Yeah, we'll look at this.
Is that nowhere in my my requirements dot</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1187-1
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.735
<v John Miller>MD file? In fact, why don't I?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1189-0
01:04:31.575 --> 01:04:35.255
<v John Miller>Show you that if I go to that business
rules MD file here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1191-0
01:04:37.175 --> 01:04:38.455
<v John Miller>Let me do a search.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1193-0
01:04:41.455 --> 01:04:42.295
<v John Miller>For students.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1195-0
01:04:43.615 --> 01:04:48.161
<v John Miller>So no place in my business rules have I
actually specified that I want to see a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1195-1
01:04:48.161 --> 01:04:48.615
<v John Miller>student.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1199-0
01:04:50.255 --> 01:04:54.624
<v John Miller>Implemented.
So this is something I don't know if you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1199-1
01:04:54.624 --> 01:05:00.207
<v John Miller>would call it a hallucination,
but it's something that it's inferred</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1199-2
01:05:00.207 --> 01:05:00.935
<v John Miller>from the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1202-0
01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:07.957
<v John Miller>From the business rules that I've
described and the workflows that I've</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1202-1
01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:11.295
<v John Miller>described that there is something akin to
a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1206-0
01:05:12.215 --> 01:05:16.729
<v John Miller>Academic to a student that should be
involved in this and this would be one of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1206-1
01:05:16.729 --> 01:05:21.358
<v John Miller>the things I would try to improve on is
that particularly when you're working in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1206-2
01:05:21.358 --> 01:05:25.815
<v John Miller>vertical slices and and like I said,
I I don't need to bring in entities into</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1206-3
01:05:25.815 --> 01:05:29.415
<v John Miller>the model that I don't already that
aren't explicitly defined.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1208-0
01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:33.855
<v John Miller>And so quite a bit of the effort was was.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1213-0
01:05:34.735 --> 01:05:40.784
<v John Miller>Quite a bit of effort was put into the
process of actually, you know,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1213-1
01:05:40.784 --> 01:05:47.093
<v John Miller>in the implementation for supporting the
student in the in in the actual</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1213-2
01:05:47.093 --> 01:05:50.895
<v John Miller>implementation with things like
enrollment.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1215-0
01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:58.820
<v John Miller>And grading,
you know we make until the model makes a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1215-1
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.655
<v John Miller>reference that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1220-0
01:06:02.255 --> 01:06:07.825
<v John Miller>That that a course can can be graded,
but it doesn't specifically specify that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1220-1
01:06:07.825 --> 01:06:13.395
<v John Miller>that that the student is being graded.
So that was this was something that was</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1220-2
01:06:13.395 --> 01:06:17.695
<v John Miller>that was obvious that I needed to kind of
tighten up on the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1223-0
01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:23.569
<v John Miller>Instructions to try to to make sure that
it was actually not bringing something</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1223-1
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:29.415
<v John Miller>into the model that or into the into the
application that wasn't actually defined.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1226-0
01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:38.047
<v John Miller>All right,
so once we have all of these instructions</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1226-1
01:06:38.047 --> 01:06:40.535
<v John Miller>created, there is a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1230-0
01:06:42.095 --> 01:06:47.960
<v John Miller>Another prompt,
a prompt file that says go ahead and now</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1230-1
01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:54.443
<v John Miller>create implementation prompts to to guide
that implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1230-2
01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:57.015
<v John Miller>So what this prompt does.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1237-0
01:07:06.335 --> 01:07:13.436
<v John Miller>Basically it goes to what the prop file
requirements are and then what the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1237-1
01:07:13.436 --> 01:07:16.655
<v John Miller>implementation task format is and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1242-0
01:07:18.255 --> 01:07:21.679
<v John Miller>What the verification framework looks
like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1242-1
01:07:21.679 --> 01:07:27.048
<v John Miller>Then it goes what the academic components
that need to be addressed.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1242-2
01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:30.705
<v John Miller>So a core infrastructure,
academic management,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1242-3
01:07:30.705 --> 01:07:33.895
<v John Miller>administrative function, user interfaces.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1246-0
01:07:35.455 --> 01:07:41.552
<v John Miller>What the what the quality assurance
requirements are and what an example of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1246-1
01:07:41.552 --> 01:07:48.210
<v John Miller>verification checklists are and what the
success criteria are for for implementing</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1246-2
01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:49.975
<v John Miller>that particular piece.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1250-0
01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:56.420
<v John Miller>And so running this prompt basically
means that it's what it's going to do is</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1250-1
01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.717
<v John Miller>going to,
it's going to take those business</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1250-2
01:07:59.717 --> 01:08:05.336
<v John Miller>requirements and it's going to and the
instruction files and it's going to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1250-3
01:08:05.336 --> 01:08:06.535
<v John Miller>produce prompts.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1254-0
01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:12.810
<v John Miller>In the generated folder to actually do
the implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1254-1
01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:20.228
<v John Miller>So here using a more layered approach,
what it's saying is I want to do a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1254-2
01:08:20.228 --> 01:08:22.935
<v John Miller>foundation database schema.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1259-0
01:08:23.295 --> 01:08:29.043
<v John Miller>And then a authentication implementation
that I want to do an infrastructure API</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1259-1
01:08:29.043 --> 01:08:33.016
<v John Miller>infrastructure implementation,
core student management,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1259-2
01:08:33.016 --> 01:08:37.203
<v John Miller>faculty management,
course catalog management and piece by</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1259-3
01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:39.615
<v John Miller>piece with the idea that we would.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1261-0
01:08:40.935 --> 01:08:46.095
<v John Miller>Then use these to help us actually
implement the the app. So here we have.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1262-0
01:08:47.815 --> 01:08:47.895
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1264-0
01:08:51.575 --> 01:08:51.735
<v John Miller>Again.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1265-0
01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:53.935
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1267-0
01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:58.135
<v John Miller>I need to go here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1272-0
01:09:08.455 --> 01:09:13.491
<v John Miller>So this would be the instructions for
setting up a database schema and and and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1272-1
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.575
<v John Miller>entity framework.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1277-0
01:09:16.695 --> 01:09:22.673
<v John Miller>So the the intent here is that this is be
a given us instructions for a developer</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1277-1
01:09:22.673 --> 01:09:28.141
<v John Miller>or the NAI assistant to help with
actually the implementation of this core</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1277-2
01:09:28.141 --> 01:09:32.005
<v John Miller>data model.
So here we have the the it's broken down</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1277-3
01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:36.015
<v John Miller>into tasks.
We have a series of tasks that need to be.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1281-0
01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:42.158
<v John Miller>Executed what the task description is.
Configure Entity Framework Core in the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1281-1
01:09:42.158 --> 01:09:45.938
<v John Miller>infrastructure project with a SQL Server
provider.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1281-2
01:09:45.938 --> 01:09:51.572
<v John Miller>Entity Framework Core packaging packages
that are we'll be using create the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1281-3
01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:53.055
<v John Miller>Academia DB context.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1286-0
01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:56.359
<v John Miller>Configure connection string for
management.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1286-1
01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:01.244
<v John Miller>Set up the dependency injection
registration with the acceptance criteria</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1286-2
01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:06.393
<v John Miller>for that particular task would be that we
have EF core packages installed and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1286-3
01:10:06.393 --> 01:10:10.815
<v John Miller>referenced the academia class created
with a proper configuration.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1290-0
01:10:11.215 --> 01:10:16.623
<v John Miller>The connection string is configurable via
app settings dot Jason and that the DB</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1290-1
01:10:16.623 --> 01:10:22.231
<v John Miller>contest is registered and so this what we
can do then we can then say OK AI can you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1290-2
01:10:22.231 --> 01:10:27.572
<v John Miller>help me implement this this from this
particular project can you implement task</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1290-3
01:10:27.572 --> 01:10:29.975
<v John Miller>one and then it will go through and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1292-0
01:10:30.575 --> 01:10:34.415
<v John Miller>Do its best to try to actually fulfill
these requirements.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1293-0
01:10:35.575 --> 01:10:36.895
<v John Miller>Does that make sense?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1297-0
01:10:38.815 --> 01:10:46.042
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Is it John? I was offline a little bit.
What's the end end goal or end product</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1297-1
01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.695
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>coming out of this framework?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1299-0
01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:52.579
<v John Miller>Uh,
we were hoping to see an application that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1299-1
01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:54.935
<v John Miller>we can actually that we can actually run.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1300-0
01:10:56.215 --> 01:10:58.215
<v John Miller>And and test.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1302-0
01:10:58.695 --> 01:11:01.375
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>And this application would do what?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1309-0
01:11:02.455 --> 01:11:08.221
<v John Miller>Well it well we defined in the business
requirements that it's a an academia</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1309-1
01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:14.212
<v John Miller>application that manages faculty and what
those how those how that faculty what</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1309-2
01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:19.454
<v John Miller>their what their roles are.
I'm using a I'm using a standard you know</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1305-0
01:11:14.295 --> 01:11:14.415
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1307-0
01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:17.015
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Got it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1309-3
01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:21.775
<v John Miller>business model for this that's.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1313-0
01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:27.833
<v John Miller>I I took from a a website that has you
know has detailed description of actually</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1313-1
01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:32.619
<v John Miller>how the model is created.
So I'm basically making an assumption</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1313-2
01:11:32.619 --> 01:11:38.975
<v John Miller>that here that we have a we have business
requirements we've we've documented those.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1318-0
01:11:39.535 --> 01:11:44.052
<v John Miller>Business requirements in some level of
detail, right through use cases,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1318-1
01:11:44.052 --> 01:11:49.321
<v John Miller>through whatever other documentation that
we would want it to have the AI consider.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1315-0
01:11:46.295 --> 01:11:46.455
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Right.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1318-2
01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:54.402
<v John Miller>And then I'm going through a process of
analyzing those business requirements or</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1318-3
01:11:54.402 --> 01:11:56.095
<v John Miller>having AI assist with that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1322-0
01:11:56.895 --> 01:12:01.817
<v John Miller>To turn that into instructions to guide
the implementation,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1322-1
01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:07.970
<v John Miller>as well as instructions for the
implementation in terms of specific tasks.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1322-2
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:11.415
<v John Miller>So you could easily turn this like into a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1327-0
01:12:12.575 --> 01:12:18.645
<v John Miller>You know into a a a task in a work item
system that says OK you need to go about</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1327-1
01:12:18.645 --> 01:12:24.565
<v John Miller>and implement this as a as a task to
create this in the case of the source one</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1327-2
01:12:24.565 --> 01:12:29.735
<v John Miller>the the core entity framework set up in
order to get it implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1331-0
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:37.161
<v John Miller>And then some developer could pick this
up and and and do that implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1331-1
01:12:37.161 --> 01:12:41.996
<v John Miller>In this experiment though,
I'm actually I use it to give it to AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1331-2
01:12:41.996 --> 01:12:47.855
<v John Miller>and ask AI to to actually attempt the
implementation first and I'll talk about.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1333-0
01:12:47.855 --> 01:12:53.135
<v John Miller>That process and how that process went in
a bit.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1334-0
01:12:53.575 --> 01:12:54.695
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Thank you.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1335-0
01:12:55.775 --> 01:12:57.495
<v John Miller>Other questions on this?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1340-0
01:12:58.255 --> 01:13:01.848
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, I have a question.
So when you look at the end to end</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1340-1
01:13:01.848 --> 01:13:06.804
<v Majernik, Peter>process starting with the ORM diagram all
the way to the up and running working</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1340-2
01:13:06.804 --> 01:13:09.963
<v Majernik, Peter>product,
how much manual tweaking did you actually</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1340-3
01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:14.175
<v Majernik, Peter>do to the instruction files or the prompt
files or the actual code?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1344-0
01:13:15.295 --> 01:13:20.429
<v John Miller>I I you know because that was an
experiment I did I I'm treating the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1344-1
01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:26.382
<v John Miller>iterations that as a whole cycle through
the process as opposed to stopping and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1344-2
01:13:26.382 --> 01:13:32.111
<v John Miller>evaluating each individual way because
then I can by by doing that I can see</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1344-3
01:13:32.111 --> 01:13:32.855
<v John Miller>where the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1349-0
01:13:33.055 --> 01:13:36.250
<v John Miller>AI instructions are not adequate.
For example,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1349-1
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:41.621
<v John Miller>the fact that it created a student and we
didn't need a student in part of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1349-2
01:13:41.621 --> 01:13:46.516
<v John Miller>domain is obviously a problem with the
instructions that I'm giving AI,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1349-3
01:13:46.516 --> 01:13:51.615
<v John Miller>and I need to kind of loop back and
figure out what that is if you were to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1349-4
01:13:51.615 --> 01:13:52.975
<v John Miller>follow this process.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1354-0
01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:56.966
<v John Miller>Real world application.
You would stop at every case.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1354-1
01:13:56.966 --> 01:14:02.108
<v John Miller>You would look at every file,
tweak them and move them forward because</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1354-2
01:14:02.108 --> 01:14:06.381
<v John Miller>you're focusing on developing one
application at the time.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1354-3
01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:12.175
<v John Miller>I'm trying to make this an iterative
process so I can improve it so it becomes.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1355-0
01:14:12.255 --> 01:14:17.655
<v John Miller>Easier to take advantage of and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1359-0
01:14:17.695 --> 01:14:23.263
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, sorry, how many iterations?
How many iterations does it take to get</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1357-0
01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:20.935
<v John Miller>No, go ahead.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1359-1
01:14:23.263 --> 01:14:25.815
<v Majernik, Peter>to where you want to be, roughly?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1363-0
01:14:26.775 --> 01:14:33.603
<v John Miller>Well, so the the first one I tried,
I didn't actually make it all the way</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1363-1
01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:39.970
<v John Miller>through the process to the UI,
so I didn't have anything to show but</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1363-2
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:41.815
<v John Miller>like a back end API.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1369-0
01:14:42.175 --> 01:14:45.937
<v John Miller>So in the second iteration,
which I'm showing you here,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1369-1
01:14:45.937 --> 01:14:51.378
<v John Miller>I wanted to make sure I got at least that
far because I wanted to see how the AI</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1369-2
01:14:51.378 --> 01:14:56.684
<v John Miller>would go about building a user interface
based on just these requirements that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1369-3
01:14:56.684 --> 01:14:59.774
<v John Miller>I've given it so far,
what the use cases are,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1369-4
01:14:59.774 --> 01:15:01.655
<v John Miller>what the business rules are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1372-0
01:15:02.455 --> 01:15:07.969
<v John Miller>Right. And I made,
I made really good progress on that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1372-1
01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:12.695
<v John Miller>There's a a couple of dashboards and some
some.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1376-0
01:15:13.935 --> 01:15:23.758
<v John Miller>Maintenance applications that that that
actually work and and that was so I so I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1376-1
01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:29.215
<v John Miller>feel like I've made a lot of progress
there.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1381-0
01:15:29.535 --> 01:15:36.124
<v John Miller>And it certainly would give you something
that you could then take as a starting</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1381-1
01:15:36.124 --> 01:15:42.143
<v John Miller>point and further refine it with
additional AI assistance and hand coding</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1381-2
01:15:42.143 --> 01:15:46.779
<v John Miller>to actually produce something that was
production ready.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1381-3
01:15:46.779 --> 01:15:48.975
<v John Miller>I don't think it was quite.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1386-0
01:15:49.055 --> 01:15:53.779
<v John Miller>There in this iteration yet,
and what I want to try to do in this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1386-1
01:15:53.779 --> 01:15:59.075
<v John Miller>third iteration is what I've decided is
one that model I showed is fairly</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1386-2
01:15:59.075 --> 01:16:02.367
<v John Miller>comprehensive in terms of its problem
domain.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1386-3
01:16:02.367 --> 01:16:07.735
<v John Miller>So what I want to do is pare that down to
a smaller set of business rules.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1389-0
01:16:08.695 --> 01:16:13.436
<v John Miller>And do a quicker implementation so I can
iterate a little bit faster and prove out</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1389-1
01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:17.549
<v John Miller>the process a little bit farther.
Because what I really want to see and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1389-2
01:16:17.549 --> 01:16:22.061
<v John Miller>want to be able to demonstrate is the
business rules that we defined in the in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1389-3
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:22.975
<v John Miller>the arm diagram.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1392-0
01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:30.276
<v John Miller>Get implemented in numerous places in the
application and enforce those business</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1392-1
01:16:30.276 --> 01:16:30.775
<v John Miller>rules.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1397-0
01:16:32.015 --> 01:16:36.611
<v John Miller>That's what I want to see is that
traceability because that one gives you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1397-1
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:41.144
<v John Miller>the the confidence that your your
application is actually doing what you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1397-2
01:16:41.144 --> 01:16:44.746
<v John Miller>suggested it to do.
Now of course you know there's always</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1397-3
01:16:44.746 --> 01:16:49.652
<v John Miller>improvements that can be made in there
into and this will give you I think a a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1397-4
01:16:49.652 --> 01:16:50.335
<v John Miller>shell of a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1399-0
01:16:50.335 --> 01:16:55.239
<v John Miller>Or beginnings of of an implementation,
but I think it does a a pretty good job</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1399-1
01:16:55.239 --> 01:16:58.095
<v John Miller>on the back end pieces of it in
particularly.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1400-0
01:17:01.095 --> 01:17:02.775
<v John Miller>All right, so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1402-0
01:17:01.335 --> 01:17:05.455
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. OK. So oh, go ahead. I.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1407-0
01:17:04.335 --> 01:17:08.036
<v John Miller>And really the, yeah,
so the exercise is say, OK,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1407-1
01:17:08.036 --> 01:17:13.808
<v John Miller>you're doing greenfield development and
you want to have AI help you do that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1407-2
01:17:13.808 --> 01:17:18.989
<v John Miller>This is I'm trying to show you can
actually get a lot of help in that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1407-3
01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:22.615
<v John Miller>Greenfield development space if you go
about it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1409-0
01:17:22.895 --> 01:17:29.415
<v John Miller>Go about it systematically and get AI
involved in it from the very beginning.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1412-0
01:17:29.735 --> 01:17:33.412
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, I think I get it.
So if I was to develop 100 similar apps,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1412-1
01:17:33.412 --> 01:17:38.256
<v Majernik, Peter>then the iterations would help me perfect
my instruction files that give me a good</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1412-2
01:17:38.256 --> 01:17:39.015
<v Majernik, Peter>start, right?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1417-0
01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:45.246
<v Majernik, Peter>And then if I'm working on the same app,
then the iterations will be just</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1413-0
01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:43.255
<v John Miller>Well.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1417-1
01:17:45.246 --> 01:17:48.753
<v Majernik, Peter>improving the end result,
which is the source code.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1417-2
01:17:48.753 --> 01:17:51.855
<v Majernik, Peter>I think that at least that's how I see it
is.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1420-0
01:17:49.895 --> 01:17:54.204
<v John Miller>Well, so yeah,
I what I would say is that this is,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1420-1
01:17:54.204 --> 01:17:57.753
<v John Miller>you know,
if this was guiding an existing</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1420-2
01:17:57.753 --> 01:18:02.400
<v John Miller>application,
the the the the instruction files that we</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1420-3
01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.935
<v John Miller>have here would be applicable.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1425-0
01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:09.718
<v John Miller>Whether you're doing manual coding or
whether you're doing AI assisted coding.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1425-1
01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:13.896
<v John Miller>So it's it's something that you can then
you know you can tweak and you can</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1425-2
01:18:13.896 --> 01:18:17.579
<v John Miller>improve as you go along.
And the other thing that I think would be</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1425-3
01:18:17.579 --> 01:18:21.372
<v John Miller>important about this is that, OK,
let's say that we did want student</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1425-4
01:18:21.372 --> 01:18:25.055
<v John Miller>involved and it wasn't actually
implemented. We got to expand the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1429-0
01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:30.711
<v John Miller>That we're kind of trying to support,
we can add to the conceptual model and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1429-1
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:36.505
<v John Miller>then we can use that to produce much of
the implementation to support those two</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1429-2
01:18:36.505 --> 01:18:40.415
<v John Miller>concepts that we've introduced at the
very beginning.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1431-0
01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:47.042
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.
And do we still have time for questions</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1431-1
01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:48.175
<v Majernik, Peter>or are we?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1433-0
01:18:47.415 --> 01:18:50.135
<v John Miller>Sure. Ohh</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1437-0
01:18:49.135 --> 01:18:54.838
<v Majernik, Peter>So one more one more question I have is
let's say I I heard there is something</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1437-1
01:18:54.838 --> 01:18:59.313
<v Majernik, Peter>called GitHub Spark.
So I wonder if I could take just the ORM</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1437-2
01:18:59.313 --> 01:19:02.489
<v Majernik, Peter>diagram and say something like hey
Copilot,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1437-3
01:19:02.489 --> 01:19:07.975
<v Majernik, Peter>use GitHub Spark and generate a fully
functional app from this ORM diagram.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1442-0
01:19:08.575 --> 01:19:13.069
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that possible today and is it feasible,
practical,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1439-0
01:19:11.975 --> 01:19:12.015
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1442-1
01:19:13.069 --> 01:19:15.815
<v Majernik, Peter>or is that science fiction still?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1440-0
01:19:13.535 --> 01:19:13.975
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1446-0
01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:22.143
<v John Miller>You know, I I I've looked at,
I've looked at Spark and I think it would</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1446-1
01:19:22.143 --> 01:19:27.459
<v John Miller>be another interesting experiment to
compare the two approaches,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1446-2
01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:32.202
<v John Miller>but I'm I'm essentially trying to do the
same thing here,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1446-3
01:19:32.202 --> 01:19:34.655
<v John Miller>but make it a little bit more.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1450-0
01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:41.840
<v John Miller>I I guess having having humans in the
loop a little bit more than maybe Spark</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1450-1
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.690
<v John Miller>is gonna do. But yeah,
I I think it would be an interesting</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1450-2
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:50.650
<v John Miller>approach,
but I would say in addition to the ARM</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1450-3
01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:51.135
<v John Miller>model.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1454-0
01:19:51.255 --> 01:19:55.063
<v John Miller>I would you want to define use cases as
well. To me,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1454-1
01:19:55.063 --> 01:20:00.380
<v John Miller>that's two sides of the same coin.
There's the structural side of things,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1454-2
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:05.194
<v John Miller>which Orms handles very well,
but then there's the process side of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1454-3
01:20:05.194 --> 01:20:06.415
<v John Miller>things, which is.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1457-0
01:20:06.495 --> 01:20:13.058
<v John Miller>I think better described in a use in a
use case or a similar kind of structure</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1457-1
01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.055
<v John Miller>or document.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1459-0
01:20:14.535 --> 01:20:17.596
<v Majernik, Peter>OK,
so this this diagramming tool or language</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1459-1
01:20:17.596 --> 01:20:22.055
<v Majernik, Peter>is basically not sufficient to capture
all the use cases, correct?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1463-0
01:20:22.775 --> 01:20:28.537
<v John Miller>No, it's not. Yeah, it's it.
It came up out of the database modeling</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1463-1
01:20:28.537 --> 01:20:32.879
<v John Miller>community.
It was initially used to define database</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1463-2
01:20:32.879 --> 01:20:38.975
<v John Miller>schemas to, you know, it would create.
It could create schemas that are.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1469-0
01:20:38.975 --> 01:20:42.202
<v John Miller>You know,
compliant with the 5th normal form,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1469-1
01:20:42.202 --> 01:20:45.359
<v John Miller>so you can. So it's very,
very good at that,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1465-0
01:20:42.775 --> 01:20:42.895
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1469-2
01:20:45.359 --> 01:20:51.042
<v John Miller>but there is little support for process
in it and so you need to you need to use</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1469-3
01:20:51.042 --> 01:20:56.444
<v John Miller>some other way of defining that I think
in order to be able to get something</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1469-4
01:20:56.444 --> 01:20:56.935
<v John Miller>that's.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1470-0
01:20:57.135 --> 01:20:58.615
<v John Miller>Usable.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1471-0
01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.135
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thank you.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1475-0
01:21:10.575 --> 01:21:11.375
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1479-0
01:21:18.335 --> 01:21:22.535
<v John Miller>Let me define those what those are I
think we looked at.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1485-0
01:21:26.895 --> 01:21:32.506
<v John Miller>Yeah, so implementation tasks.
So the first task was to create up the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1485-1
01:21:32.506 --> 01:21:37.156
<v John Miller>Entity Framework core setup,
then the core entity models,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1485-2
01:21:37.156 --> 01:21:43.008
<v John Miller>the academic structure entities
themselves, the infrastructure entities,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1485-3
01:21:43.008 --> 01:21:46.695
<v John Miller>the data,
create database database migration.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1488-0
01:21:46.815 --> 01:21:55.999
<v John Miller>Implement the repository pattern and then
it has some verification steps,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1488-1
01:21:55.999 --> 01:22:00.095
<v John Miller>so it's looking for a particular.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1492-0
01:22:02.175 --> 01:22:07.668
<v John Miller>Methods to be implemented and then so
integration testing and performance</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1492-1
01:22:07.668 --> 01:22:13.384
<v John Miller>testing against the the database,
what the code quality standards should be,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1492-2
01:22:13.384 --> 01:22:17.095
<v John Miller>how it should integrate with the existing
system.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1496-0
01:22:17.535 --> 01:22:26.214
<v John Miller>And it finishes with the database schema
can accurately reflect that that or model</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1496-1
01:22:26.214 --> 01:22:30.815
<v John Miller>if we were to go back here and look at
the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1497-0
01:22:32.135 --> 01:22:32.935
<v John Miller>Timeline.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1499-0
01:22:35.495 --> 01:22:38.855
<v John Miller>Uh, actually source.
I want the source tree.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1503-0
01:22:43.455 --> 01:22:49.975
<v John Miller>So we go in down to the bottom.
So here's the the initial commit and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1504-0
01:22:51.735 --> 01:22:51.815
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1506-0
01:22:53.615 --> 01:22:56.135
<v John Miller>We look at the changes for that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1509-0
01:22:57.335 --> 01:23:02.645
<v John Miller>Basically the only thing I have in the
initial commit is the MIT is the the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1509-1
01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:06.558
<v John Miller>license file.
So if you follow this you can say oh well</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1509-2
01:23:06.558 --> 01:23:08.095
<v John Miller>show me those changes.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1510-0
01:23:10.095 --> 01:23:10.775
<v John Miller>And.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1513-0
01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:17.335
<v John Miller>I guess maybe not that one. Oh,
here I added a PNG file to it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1515-0
01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.815
<v John Miller>Here I added the business rules.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1520-0
01:23:26.015 --> 01:23:31.232
<v John Miller>Here it's creating the instruction files.
I made a small change to the OR model,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1520-1
01:23:31.232 --> 01:23:36.707
<v John Miller>updated the project overview instructions.
So you can see here I'm going through all</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1520-2
01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:40.185
<v John Miller>of the steps.
So what I basically tried to do is as I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1520-3
01:23:40.185 --> 01:23:42.375
<v John Miller>was going through the process was.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1523-0
01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:50.055
<v John Miller>Do a commit that illustrates where I was
in that in that process. So this is all.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1527-0
01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:57.050
<v John Miller>Going through and and just doing the prep
work before I started to generate code</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1527-1
01:23:57.050 --> 01:24:02.308
<v John Miller>and then you can see here I'm starting to
actually add in implementations</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1527-2
01:24:02.308 --> 01:24:06.855
<v John Miller>instructions and and we're start to
implement individual tasks.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1532-0
01:24:07.215 --> 01:24:11.489
<v John Miller>So here's task three.
So here I'm in prompt three in task one</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1532-1
01:24:11.489 --> 01:24:17.210
<v John Miller>and I want to continue to try to improve
on my ability by process here by with the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1532-2
01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:22.449
<v John Miller>idea that you could essentially go
through the commit log and you could see</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1532-3
01:24:22.449 --> 01:24:25.895
<v John Miller>how the application grew from the
business roles.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1535-0
01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:34.695
<v John Miller>The roles all the way through in here,
Prop 11 and task two, task three,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1535-1
01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:35.895
<v John Miller>et cetera.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1538-0
01:24:39.735 --> 01:24:45.049
<v John Miller>So because again, it's experiment,
I'm gonna be able to repeat it and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1538-1
01:24:45.049 --> 01:24:47.175
<v John Miller>improve on it going forward.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1543-0
01:24:49.615 --> 01:24:53.399
<v John Miller>And it really, like I said,
the goal is to really lean heavily into</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1543-1
01:24:53.399 --> 01:24:57.852
<v John Miller>the A I side of things because we really
want to know how much it can assist us</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1543-2
01:24:57.852 --> 01:25:02.137
<v John Miller>and how close it can get to do to get
into something that we can show people</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1543-3
01:25:02.137 --> 01:25:04.975
<v John Miller>that it's working and doing what we want
it to do.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1545-0
01:25:07.775 --> 01:25:09.455
<v John Miller>All right. Any questions there?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1549-0
01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:14.260
<v John Miller>Now I will.
I will say that I did not make it through</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1549-1
01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:19.430
<v John Miller>every single prompt and every single task.
There were some things I I chose to leave</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1549-2
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:24.053
<v John Miller>out just simply because I had a deadline
and I wanted to be able to present</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1549-3
01:25:24.053 --> 01:25:25.695
<v John Miller>something that was working.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1552-0
01:25:26.095 --> 01:25:30.769
<v John Miller>At that at that deadline.
And so I I kind of shortcuted the process</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1552-1
01:25:30.769 --> 01:25:33.175
<v John Miller>and and lefted it, lefted it there.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1554-0
01:25:38.575 --> 01:25:39.735
<v John Miller>All right, so um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1558-0
01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:45.947
<v John Miller>Then then in terms of actual
implementation,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1558-1
01:25:45.947 --> 01:25:51.731
<v John Miller>if we look at the file itself,
the code itself outside of the GitHub</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1558-2
01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.575
<v John Miller>folder and our models.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1559-0
01:25:57.055 --> 01:25:58.775
<v John Miller>Under source.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1565-0
01:25:59.935 --> 01:26:06.315
<v John Miller>It created an admin interface, an API,
coverage tests, a faculty dashboard,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1565-1
01:26:06.315 --> 01:26:10.428
<v John Miller>the actual implementation of the
infrastructure,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1565-2
01:26:10.428 --> 01:26:17.143
<v John Miller>which is another thing I didn't get to
see implemented to be OK now I want this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1565-3
01:26:17.143 --> 01:26:19.325
<v John Miller>to be deployed into Azure.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1567-0
01:26:19.695 --> 01:26:24.095
<v John Miller>A student portal and then a bunch of
tests if I were to go to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1568-0
01:26:25.935 --> 01:26:27.975
<v John Miller>The terminal window.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1573-0
01:26:35.935 --> 01:26:39.095
<v John Miller>And change into our.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1575-0
01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.175
<v John Miller>And say.net test.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1577-0
01:26:51.095 --> 01:26:51.335
<v John Miller>Oops.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1583-0
01:27:02.415 --> 01:27:07.760
<v John Miller>Since I asked it to to use a, you know,
a test driven development and to make</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1583-1
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.775
<v John Miller>sure that there was tests for the the
work.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1586-0
01:27:16.175 --> 01:27:20.313
<v John Miller>You can see it's a pretty substantial
project in terms of the the time it's</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1586-1
01:27:20.313 --> 01:27:22.055
<v John Miller>gonna take to do a core compile.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1596-0
01:27:49.975 --> 01:27:51.495
<v John Miller>And now it's going to the testing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1600-0
01:27:59.655 --> 01:28:07.715
<v John Miller>So all the tests run 1061 individual
tasks and all they've all they're all</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1600-1
01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:08.575
<v John Miller>passing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1601-0
01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:10.575
<v John Miller>8.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1603-0
01:28:11.535 --> 01:28:13.815
<v John Miller>So, so far so good.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1605-0
01:28:16.255 --> 01:28:17.495
<v John Miller>Any questions?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1607-0
01:28:22.335 --> 01:28:23.855
<v Carter, Jake>I I have a question but.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1608-0
01:28:22.855 --> 01:28:24.695
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>It was go ahead.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1614-0
01:28:25.335 --> 01:28:28.422
<v Carter, Jake>So just like in terms of like start to
finish,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1614-1
01:28:28.422 --> 01:28:32.100
<v Carter, Jake>all you're doing is interacting with the
agents, right?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1614-2
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:36.960
<v Carter, Jake>How long did all this take to like
produce this this application like say</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1614-3
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.455
<v Carter, Jake>you you start with the business logic?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1618-0
01:28:41.055 --> 01:28:44.748
<v Carter, Jake>And then like you, you know,
like from when you press run for the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1613-0
01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:41.255
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1618-1
01:28:44.748 --> 01:28:47.490
<v Carter, Jake>first time.
And then of course maybe you have to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1616-0
01:28:44.935 --> 01:28:45.175
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1618-2
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:51.015
<v Carter, Jake>press run multiple times,
but how long is that all that thick?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1623-0
01:28:52.095 --> 01:28:57.019
<v John Miller>It it it took, you know,
I'm working on this part time,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1623-1
01:28:57.019 --> 01:29:03.614
<v John Miller>so it took probably 3 weeks worth of
partial time to get to get it to this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1623-2
01:29:03.614 --> 01:29:08.010
<v John Miller>point. And sometimes, you know,
some days it was,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1623-3
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.615
<v John Miller>I was able to spend more time on it than.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1626-0
01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:16.263
<v John Miller>Others, but um,
which that's something I want to also</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1626-1
01:29:16.263 --> 01:29:19.255
<v John Miller>improve is, you know, time tracking.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1630-0
01:29:21.215 --> 01:29:27.198
<v John Miller>So that I I can I can answer that
question with more precision than than I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1630-1
01:29:27.198 --> 01:29:31.905
<v John Miller>I'm able to do now.
I had let me I think I have a slide to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1630-2
01:29:31.905 --> 01:29:35.175
<v John Miller>kind of help illustrate the how it works.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1632-0
01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:42.845
<v John Miller>Maybe I don't so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1637-0
01:29:42.135 --> 01:29:46.919
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, so like when you say 3 weeks,
is that mostly just like pressing run on</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1637-1
01:29:46.919 --> 01:29:49.902
<v Carter, Jake>like the different prompts that it's
generated?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1637-2
01:29:49.902 --> 01:29:54.810
<v Carter, Jake>Or is it like you're reviewing the work
and you know you have to like add your</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1637-3
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:57.295
<v Carter, Jake>own feedback like in between these runs?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1635-0
01:29:56.575 --> 01:29:57.735
<v John Miller>Well, um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1642-0
01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:04.159
<v John Miller>So the the the way the process worked was
this is I would go into the the the chat</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1642-1
01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:07.431
<v John Miller>window and I would say OK for prompt one,
task one,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1642-2
01:30:07.431 --> 01:30:10.955
<v John Miller>could you go ahead and implement prop one
and task one.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1642-3
01:30:10.955 --> 01:30:16.116
<v John Miller>So then it would read those that portion
of the prompt file and it would bring in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1642-4
01:30:16.116 --> 01:30:17.815
<v John Miller>the instruction files that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1646-0
01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:24.748
<v John Miller>And then it would go ahead and do that
implementation because that task had</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1646-1
01:30:24.748 --> 01:30:30.957
<v John Miller>validation criteria at the end of it and
so I would expect that those that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1646-2
01:30:30.957 --> 01:30:33.855
<v John Miller>validation criteria would pass and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1650-0
01:30:34.015 --> 01:30:40.703
<v John Miller>What I would do once it finished,
I would actually ask it to verify that it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1650-1
01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:47.655
<v John Miller>actually had had completed those those
completed the the implementation and it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1650-2
01:30:47.655 --> 01:30:49.415
<v John Miller>passed all of those.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1655-0
01:30:50.535 --> 01:30:54.437
<v John Miller>Validation requirements.
What I found is that as it was going</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1655-1
01:30:54.437 --> 01:30:58.087
<v John Miller>through the process of actually doing the
implementation,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1655-2
01:30:58.087 --> 01:31:01.108
<v John Miller>particularly the implementation of the
testing,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1655-3
01:31:01.108 --> 01:31:06.080
<v John Miller>that there will be a lot of feedback
going back into the the model to guide it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1655-4
01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.975
<v John Miller>in terms of producing a test that would
pass.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1659-0
01:31:09.455 --> 01:31:14.747
<v John Miller>Which is something that on my list of
things to try to improve is to make sure</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1659-1
01:31:14.747 --> 01:31:18.297
<v John Miller>that it's it can get the testing closer
to the mark.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1659-2
01:31:18.297 --> 01:31:23.790
<v John Miller>But usually it would produce a bunch of
tests and it would a whole bunch of tests</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1659-3
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:28.813
<v John Miller>would fail. Then it would, you know,
guide the AI in terms of fixing those</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1659-4
01:31:28.813 --> 01:31:29.215
<v John Miller>tests.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1663-0
01:31:29.375 --> 01:31:34.262
<v John Miller>But I deliberately tried to not change
the model or change the instructions</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1663-1
01:31:34.262 --> 01:31:37.477
<v John Miller>because I wanted to see where they failed,
right?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1663-2
01:31:37.477 --> 01:31:42.299
<v John Miller>Because it's kind of an exercise in
failure in order to be able to get the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1663-3
01:31:42.299 --> 01:31:44.935
<v John Miller>feedback I wanted in order to improve it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1667-0
01:31:45.135 --> 01:31:50.050
<v John Miller>If I was going to try to take the same
approach and do it with a new Greenfield</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1667-1
01:31:50.050 --> 01:31:52.753
<v John Miller>app,
I would do exactly what you're saying.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1667-2
01:31:52.753 --> 01:31:57.360
<v John Miller>I would take more time for a review to
make sure that at each point in the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1667-3
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.415
<v John Miller>process I was comfortable with what the
AI had actually produced.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1671-0
01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:06.814
<v John Miller>That so that I could improve the chances
of it going forward and I would want to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1671-1
01:32:06.814 --> 01:32:10.962
<v John Miller>do that with the entire team.
So everybody would have an impact input</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1671-2
01:32:10.962 --> 01:32:14.102
<v John Miller>in terms of what those instructions would
look like,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1671-3
01:32:14.102 --> 01:32:19.020
<v John Miller>what those prompts would actually do and
then review what the output would what it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1671-4
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:19.375
<v John Miller>would.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1676-0
01:32:19.455 --> 01:32:24.686
<v John Miller>Would would look like I think it produced
produced an estimate like kind of like</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1673-0
01:32:21.255 --> 01:32:21.375
<v Carter, Jake>OK.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1676-1
01:32:24.686 --> 01:32:29.852
<v John Miller>this estimates we saw earlier of how many
I think it was saying it was going to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1676-2
01:32:29.852 --> 01:32:33.855
<v John Miller>take this somebody a good portion of
about of about 3 months.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1680-0
01:32:34.495 --> 01:32:38.729
<v John Miller>To do this implementation based on its
estimates,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1678-0
01:32:37.615 --> 01:32:37.735
<v Carter, Jake>So.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1680-1
01:32:38.729 --> 01:32:42.455
<v John Miller>but you know that's looking at 1
developer.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1684-0
01:32:40.815 --> 01:32:45.333
<v Carter, Jake>So this this was mostly like an
experiment like on the instructions,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1684-1
01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:50.374
<v Carter, Jake>not not as much on the prompts because
you were feeding it extra like prompt</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1684-2
01:32:50.374 --> 01:32:55.415
<v Carter, Jake>information when you were like prompting
it to run implement different like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1685-0
01:32:56.175 --> 01:32:57.855
<v Carter, Jake>I don't remember the word you use.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1683-0
01:32:57.095 --> 01:32:57.215
<v John Miller>Well.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1691-0
01:32:58.335 --> 01:33:02.080
<v John Miller>Well, I, you know, you know,
basically the only input I I gave it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1691-1
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.790
<v John Miller>outside of just guiding it in to do to to
do the verification and to implement the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1691-2
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:11.330
<v John Miller>test and make sure that for example that
there are if there was warnings in the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1691-3
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:15.870
<v John Miller>build that those warnings were addressed,
there's test failures that those test</v>

01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:17.175
<v John Miller>failures are addressed.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1692-0
01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:23.060
<v John Miller>I didn't put any other input into other
than that initial business requirements</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1692-1
01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:23.415
<v John Miller>file.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1696-0
01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:28.139
<v Carter, Jake>But but your input was that like you
would say something like, oh,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1696-1
01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:32.016
<v Carter, Jake>make sure that you run this test or like
sort of that sort of input.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1696-2
01:33:32.016 --> 01:33:34.375
<v Carter, Jake>There was like quite a bit of that, right?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1701-0
01:33:34.895 --> 01:33:39.301
<v John Miller>There's a lot of run the tests and then
many times it would ask OK,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1701-1
01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:44.224
<v John Miller>do you want to use this approach for
fixing the tests or do you want to fix</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1701-2
01:33:44.224 --> 01:33:48.306
<v John Miller>this test first or do you want to do this
implementation next?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1701-3
01:33:48.306 --> 01:33:53.424
<v John Miller>It would have a lot of questions that
would come back to you that I would have</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1701-4
01:33:53.424 --> 01:33:54.655
<v John Miller>to make a decision.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1706-0
01:33:54.655 --> 01:33:59.068
<v John Miller>about and how it proceeded.
So it wasn't a you know one button and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1706-1
01:33:59.068 --> 01:34:03.679
<v John Miller>let it go and it goes all the way to the
the end. You know Obviously,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1706-2
01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:08.092
<v John Miller>the closer we can get to that,
the the better off we'll be and the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1706-3
01:34:08.092 --> 01:34:13.164
<v John Miller>sooner that we'll actually be able to
actually start to add our own value to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1706-4
01:34:13.164 --> 01:34:14.415
<v John Miller>the implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1705-0
01:34:14.335 --> 01:34:16.295
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, that's very interesting.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1707-0
01:34:16.295 --> 01:34:16.615
<v John Miller>Good.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1712-0
01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:23.408
<v John Miller>So, yeah,
so just to continue that discussion.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1712-1
01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:26.428
<v John Miller>So I would,
I would tell it to to do a task.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1712-2
01:34:26.428 --> 01:34:31.594
<v John Miller>It would then implement that task.
It would report that it had completed the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1712-3
01:34:31.594 --> 01:34:34.814
<v John Miller>task.
I would ask it to verify that those those</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1712-4
01:34:34.814 --> 01:34:37.095
<v John Miller>task validations were all working.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1717-0
01:34:37.135 --> 01:34:41.109
<v John Miller>And most often they were all.
It would tell me that they were all</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1717-1
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:44.541
<v John Miller>functioning properly.
This is where you might even bring</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1717-2
01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:49.298
<v John Miller>another model into the play to say I want
this other model to verify that this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1717-3
01:34:49.298 --> 01:34:54.055
<v John Miller>implementation is correct. That would be,
I think, an interesting thing to do.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1721-0
01:34:54.415 --> 01:34:59.978
<v John Miller>Then I would implement all the tasks that
way and then at the very end there was a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1721-1
01:34:59.978 --> 01:35:04.402
<v John Miller>success criteria for the whole prompt and
I would verify, use it,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1721-2
01:35:04.402 --> 01:35:09.295
<v John Miller>ask it to verify that that was done,
you know, in a real world scenario.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1726-0
01:35:09.775 --> 01:35:13.686
<v John Miller>That would be a much more hands on
process to make sure that it actually had</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1726-1
01:35:13.686 --> 01:35:17.698
<v John Miller>accomplished those things that even maybe
you would take those same validation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1726-2
01:35:17.698 --> 01:35:21.456
<v John Miller>requirements and and validate them
independently just to just so that you</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1726-3
01:35:21.456 --> 01:35:25.519
<v John Miller>have your own confidence that that was
implemented correctly and you could then</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1726-4
01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:29.175
<v John Miller>do your also your your your code review
to see that the implementation.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1730-0
01:35:29.295 --> 01:35:33.798
<v John Miller>Was up to stuff,
but with the instruction files on the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1730-1
01:35:33.798 --> 01:35:38.220
<v John Miller>implementation side,
I saw that the code was primary,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1730-2
01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:42.231
<v John Miller>pretty well structured,
pretty well implemented.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1730-3
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:45.015
<v John Miller>I didn't see a lot of issues with.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1734-0
01:35:45.215 --> 01:35:49.073
<v John Miller>The code that was generated.
So that process would go through a whole</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1734-1
01:35:49.073 --> 01:35:51.774
<v John Miller>prompt,
it would validate that prompt and then I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1734-2
01:35:51.774 --> 01:35:55.742
<v John Miller>go on to the next prompt and I would
implement that prompt in that same</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1734-3
01:35:55.742 --> 01:35:59.490
<v John Miller>fashion and make sure that by the end
result there was no warnings,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1734-4
01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:01.695
<v John Miller>no test failures, no compilation issues.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1738-0
01:36:02.255 --> 01:36:05.585
<v John Miller>All the validation criteria was
successful,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1738-1
01:36:05.585 --> 01:36:11.714
<v John Miller>but then I would go back and then have it
do a regression test and validate that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1738-2
01:36:11.714 --> 01:36:16.178
<v John Miller>the prior prompts,
all their validation criteria were were</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1738-3
01:36:16.178 --> 01:36:16.935
<v John Miller>satisfied.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1743-0
01:36:17.375 --> 01:36:20.708
<v John Miller>As well,
so that way I get so I wasn't as I was</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1743-1
01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:25.360
<v John Miller>implementing additional prompts,
I wasn't introducing some sort of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1743-2
01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.623
<v John Miller>regression failure into into previous
prompts.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1743-3
01:36:28.623 --> 01:36:33.831
<v John Miller>An improvement there might be that as
you're generating the implementation</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1743-4
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:35.775
<v John Miller>instructions that you would.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1746-0
01:36:35.895 --> 01:36:41.615
<v John Miller>Include the previous prompt's validation
requirements in the validation in the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1746-1
01:36:41.615 --> 01:36:46.973
<v John Miller>success criteria for the current prompt
and that would automatically then</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1746-2
01:36:46.973 --> 01:36:48.855
<v John Miller>introduce that regression.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1747-0
01:36:50.215 --> 01:36:50.615
<v John Miller>Testing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1752-0
01:37:01.575 --> 01:37:02.775
<v John Miller>All right, so let's um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1756-0
01:37:15.375 --> 01:37:18.446
<v John Miller>Let me look at.
I'm gonna make sure refresh my memory.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1756-1
01:37:18.446 --> 01:37:21.015
<v John Miller>I'm working on the starting it the right
way.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1760-0
01:37:32.095 --> 01:37:34.415
<v John Miller>Yeah, I think this is the one I want.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1762-0
01:37:37.815 --> 01:37:42.095
<v John Miller>So this is basically this is this is just
a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1764-0
01:37:42.815 --> 01:37:47.095
<v John Miller>A short file that I asked AI to create so
that we could.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1766-0
01:37:48.575 --> 01:37:50.895
<v John Miller>Uh, start all the services.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1768-0
01:37:57.255 --> 01:37:57.495
<v John Miller>Oops.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1780-0
01:38:29.055 --> 01:38:30.375
<v John Miller>Oh, I renamed the folder.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1781-0
01:38:32.215 --> 01:38:33.895
<v John Miller>And I didn't fix this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1796-0
01:39:15.295 --> 01:39:19.735
<v Carter, Jake>Think you need another Zeus directory in
between Git and Zeus?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1795-0
01:39:17.575 --> 01:39:17.655
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1798-0
01:39:20.655 --> 01:39:25.175
<v John Miller>Yeah, right about that.
And I also don't wanna do this, so let me.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1800-0
01:39:26.295 --> 01:39:26.815
<v John Miller>Talk that out.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1809-0
01:39:50.415 --> 01:39:53.255
<v John Miller>I think that might do the trick.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1810-0
01:39:56.055 --> 01:39:56.215
<v John Miller>No.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1813-0
01:40:00.575 --> 01:40:05.895
<v John Miller>Right, let's put in front of that.
That'll fix it.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1822-0
01:40:24.815 --> 01:40:29.735
<v John Miller>So this just goes through and builds the
project.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1823-0
01:40:31.535 --> 01:40:32.775
<v John Miller>For the different components.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1825-0
01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:35.415
<v John Miller>Uh, it also.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1827-0
01:40:37.615 --> 01:40:41.125
<v John Miller>We'll shut down anything that had already
been running so that you know that you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1827-1
01:40:41.125 --> 01:40:42.295
<v John Miller>starting with a clean slate.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1832-0
01:40:52.255 --> 01:40:58.708
<v John Miller>All right, so there we are complete.
It tells us how to actually access each</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1832-1
01:40:58.708 --> 01:40:59.295
<v John Miller>of the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1836-0
01:41:00.495 --> 01:41:07.824
<v John Miller>Each each of the the services,
either the running the the API or the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1836-1
01:41:07.824 --> 01:41:13.135
<v John Miller>actual portal.
So let's take a look first at the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1837-0
01:41:13.975 --> 01:41:15.375
<v John Miller>Student portal.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1846-0
01:41:28.175 --> 01:41:35.352
<v John Miller>So this is the the portal that I created.
I did not give it any instructions in</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1846-1
01:41:35.352 --> 01:41:41.183
<v John Miller>terms of how the UI should be built or
what it should look like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1846-2
01:41:41.183 --> 01:41:46.655
<v John Miller>So I was pleasantly surprised to see that
it was actually a.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1851-0
01:41:46.735 --> 01:41:54.180
<v John Miller>A pretty decent looking application given
the fact that it's just a I generated as</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1851-1
01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:58.217
<v John Miller>a login.
If you remember that I've been here</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1851-2
01:41:58.217 --> 01:42:03.958
<v John Miller>before, it's logged me in.
It has a for a particular student it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1851-3
01:42:03.958 --> 01:42:04.855
<v John Miller>tells you.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1856-0
01:42:05.295 --> 01:42:09.031
<v John Miller>How many courses they rolled in,
what their current GPA is,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1856-1
01:42:09.031 --> 01:42:13.079
<v John Miller>what their current credits are,
or any deadlines that they have.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1856-2
01:42:13.079 --> 01:42:17.936
<v John Miller>This is not fully implemented because I
didn't get to some of the some of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1856-3
01:42:17.936 --> 01:42:22.855
<v John Miller>implementation prompts that would have
fleshed out the implementation a little</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1856-4
01:42:22.855 --> 01:42:23.415
<v John Miller>bit more.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1857-0
01:42:24.255 --> 01:42:24.375
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1861-0
01:42:26.895 --> 01:42:32.521
<v John Miller>But it's and it the way that the way I'm
running it right now is since I did not</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1861-1
01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:36.272
<v John Miller>get it to be a a a deployable application
into Azure,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1861-2
01:42:36.272 --> 01:42:41.690
<v John Miller>it's running essentially with an in
memory database and it's I I created some</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1861-3
01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:44.815
<v John Miller>seed data to put into it so that would
have.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1866-0
01:42:45.135 --> 01:42:50.743
<v John Miller>So that it would show up.
I did put a lot of effort into helping</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1866-1
01:42:50.743 --> 01:42:57.645
<v John Miller>debug it and get it to actually function
because in many ways the first time it</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1866-2
01:42:57.645 --> 01:43:02.735
<v John Miller>came up it was a blank page and so I had
to guide it into.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1870-0
01:43:02.975 --> 01:43:09.294
<v John Miller>By pointing out things that weren't
working quite correctly and and prompted</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1870-1
01:43:09.294 --> 01:43:14.218
<v John Miller>to actually implement,
implement the features or change the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1870-2
01:43:14.218 --> 01:43:20.455
<v John Miller>implementation slightly. I didn't.
I didn't tweak the code myself directly.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1874-0
01:43:22.495 --> 01:43:26.745
<v John Miller>Um, we can go back to the dash.
This is the dashboard.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1874-1
01:43:26.745 --> 01:43:32.695
<v John Miller>Here you have my my courses so you can
see what the what you're enrolled in.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1876-0
01:43:34.095 --> 01:43:38.575
<v John Miller>So here's a a piece that's not
implemented yet.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1878-0
01:43:40.175 --> 01:43:44.295
<v John Miller>And here you can filter that by what
you're currently enrolled in.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1880-0
01:43:45.575 --> 01:43:50.042
<v John Miller>Um.
So in that I I think a bad start on an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1880-1
01:43:50.042 --> 01:43:52.015
<v John Miller>implementation. Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1884-0
01:43:54.735 --> 01:44:01.843
<v John Miller>In terms of actually implementing things,
so I I was pleasantly surprised at this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1884-1
01:44:01.843 --> 01:44:07.495
<v John Miller>The other thing I thought was fun if I
could get this to to load.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1887-0
01:44:12.975 --> 01:44:13.055
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1893-0
01:44:29.335 --> 01:44:30.855
<v John Miller>And this is quite helful.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1914-0
01:45:35.775 --> 01:45:39.255
<v John Miller>So it's figured out what port it needs to
run it on.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1920-0
01:45:40.775 --> 01:45:46.414
<v John Miller>And now here it's loaded into the simple
browser and the benefit of that is that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1920-1
01:45:46.414 --> 01:45:52.122
<v John Miller>it has this add element to chat feature.
So you can say select an element or do a</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1920-2
01:45:52.122 --> 01:45:56.299
<v John Miller>continuous selection.
So if he says say I want to select an</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1920-3
01:45:56.299 --> 01:45:58.735
<v John Miller>element then I can go through this.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1922-0
01:45:58.735 --> 01:46:01.902
<v John Miller>And I'll say if this doesn't look right
or I want to put,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1922-1
01:46:01.902 --> 01:46:05.015
<v John Miller>I want to add something to this
particular piece of the.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1924-0
01:46:06.295 --> 01:46:08.615
<v John Miller>Of the UI.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1929-0
01:46:09.935 --> 01:46:14.012
<v John Miller>We'll select that,
then add the element screenshot,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1929-1
01:46:14.012 --> 01:46:19.577
<v John Miller>which is just this piece of it.
And then you could you could ask AI to</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1929-2
01:46:19.577 --> 01:46:25.222
<v John Miller>actually assist you in modifying that or
changing that in some fashion.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1929-3
01:46:25.222 --> 01:46:27.495
<v John Miller>So if you see something like.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1934-0
01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:33.345
<v John Miller>You know here where you would like to see
more space between here and there,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1934-1
01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:38.674
<v John Miller>although I think in our portal it was
fine. You could actually then tell it OK,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1934-2
01:46:38.674 --> 01:46:44.203
<v John Miller>put more space between these two elements
and it will go then and make the changes</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1934-3
01:46:44.203 --> 01:46:46.335
<v John Miller>to the code in order to do that.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1938-0
01:46:47.655 --> 01:46:52.188
<v John Miller>So that was very helpful,
particularly as the UI was coming</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1938-1
01:46:52.188 --> 01:46:56.042
<v John Miller>together.
The other thing that was very useful was</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1938-2
01:46:56.042 --> 01:47:02.011
<v John Miller>to actually go in when you when you're
running the the portal itself like here</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1938-3
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:04.655
<v John Miller>is to bring up the debugging tools.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1939-0
01:47:04.735 --> 01:47:05.095
<v John Miller>And.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1941-0
01:47:07.615 --> 01:47:11.255
<v John Miller>I want to go to the console.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1946-0
01:47:12.855 --> 01:47:17.370
<v John Miller>So we can see that's a nice clean
debugging console,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1946-1
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:24.270
<v John Miller>but if you have an an issue here that you
want it to take to to actually you can</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1946-2
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:28.615
<v John Miller>right click and say I want to actually do
it here.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1951-0
01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:34.321
<v John Miller>To copy the entire console and then you
can go back into the chat window and say</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1951-1
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:39.204
<v John Miller>just paste that console in and then
describe what the problem that you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1951-2
01:47:39.204 --> 01:47:44.352
<v John Miller>that you're seeing or or what issue,
what error that it's actually showing up</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1951-3
01:47:44.352 --> 01:47:48.575
<v John Miller>in the console that you wanted to address
and it will go about.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1955-0
01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:56.355
<v John Miller>Analyzing the the console and and trying
to come up with a fix for every issue,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1955-1
01:47:56.355 --> 01:48:01.857
<v John Miller>whatever issue you see.
Very very efficient way I think of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1955-2
01:48:01.857 --> 01:48:04.095
<v John Miller>addressing problems and.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1957-0
01:48:04.175 --> 01:48:07.325
<v John Miller>Yeah,
I and as I went through this process,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1957-1
01:48:07.325 --> 01:48:09.615
<v John Miller>it was there was a good deal of.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1962-0
01:48:11.175 --> 01:48:16.281
<v John Miller>You know of running the application,
capturing the error messages and then</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1962-1
01:48:16.281 --> 01:48:20.569
<v John Miller>asking AI to to address those errors.
Saves a lot of, I think,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1962-2
01:48:20.569 --> 01:48:23.905
<v John Miller>a lot of drudgery trying to troubleshoot
issues,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1962-3
01:48:23.905 --> 01:48:29.419
<v John Miller>particularly issues that the A I created
on its own as opposed to something that</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1962-4
01:48:29.419 --> 01:48:29.895
<v John Miller>you've.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1963-0
01:48:30.935 --> 01:48:33.895
<v John Miller>Inherited,
but any question on that technique?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1969-0
01:48:39.935 --> 01:48:44.362
<v John Miller>So the other thing,
I don't know if I've mentioned this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1969-1
01:48:44.362 --> 01:48:48.157
<v John Miller>before,
but one of the applications I'm working</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1969-2
01:48:48.157 --> 01:48:54.402
<v John Miller>with, it has two separate repositories,
1 repository for the front end and one</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1969-3
01:48:54.402 --> 01:48:56.615
<v John Miller>repository for the back end.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1974-0
01:48:57.055 --> 01:49:03.049
<v John Miller>And sometimes I would see an error in the
console that was related to the back end</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1974-1
01:49:03.049 --> 01:49:09.042
<v John Miller>and I would ask it to create a prompt for
investigating that error on the back end</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1974-2
01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:14.891
<v John Miller>and then I would switch over to the back
end repository and then I would ask to,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1974-3
01:49:14.891 --> 01:49:16.335
<v John Miller>you know, ask AI to.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1977-0
01:49:16.495 --> 01:49:20.781
<v John Miller>To troubleshoot this problem on their
side and then they would investigate and</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1977-1
01:49:20.781 --> 01:49:25.175
<v John Miller>it would then figure out what changes
needed to be made to address that problem.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1979-0
01:49:30.935 --> 01:49:33.895
<v John Miller>Questions.
Any comments or questions on that?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1982-0
01:49:35.175 --> 01:49:40.655
<v John Miller>All right, then I let's well,
let's see one of the there's.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1984-0
01:49:45.615 --> 01:49:48.215
<v John Miller>We go back to the terminal window.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1987-0
01:49:50.975 --> 01:49:56.893
<v John Miller>Let's see. Well,
I was thinking about what port the other</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1987-1
01:49:56.893 --> 01:49:58.015
<v John Miller>one was on.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1989-0
01:50:03.215 --> 01:50:03.535
<v John Miller>Think uh.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1990-0
01:50:05.615 --> 01:50:05.895
<v John Miller>4.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1992-0
01:50:08.255 --> 01:50:10.415
<v John Miller>That's the faculty dashboard.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/1998-0
01:50:27.175 --> 01:50:28.935
<v John Miller>It's still thinking.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2005-0
01:50:46.775 --> 01:50:49.175
<v John Miller>So here we have um.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2009-0
01:50:54.095 --> 01:51:00.642
<v John Miller>Let me show you the dashboard page.
So here's the the faculty dashboard,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2009-1
01:51:00.642 --> 01:51:05.575
<v John Miller>how many active courses there are for
that particular.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2011-0
01:51:08.335 --> 01:51:09.535
<v John Miller>Professor.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2012-0
01:51:11.615 --> 01:51:13.255
<v John Miller>The courses they're teaching.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2014-0
01:51:14.735 --> 01:51:16.615
<v John Miller>What recent courses are teaching?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2017-0
01:51:17.695 --> 01:51:21.656
<v John Miller>And then you can quick actions for
opening the Gray book,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2017-1
01:51:21.656 --> 01:51:23.295
<v John Miller>some upcoming deadlines.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2021-0
01:51:25.295 --> 01:51:28.590
<v John Miller>Right.
So given the the fact that all we really</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2021-1
01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:34.287
<v John Miller>defined it was some high level workflows
that needed to be implemented and the the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2021-2
01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:39.710
<v John Miller>business rules that need to be enforced,
it's inferred quite a bit in terms of</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2021-3
01:51:39.710 --> 01:51:42.455
<v John Miller>actually what it wanted to implement so.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2023-0
01:51:42.655 --> 01:51:48.695
<v John Miller>And it's done a pretty decent job of
actually implementing.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2028-0
01:51:50.255 --> 01:51:53.035
<v John Miller>So again,
I think this is promising in terms of the</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2028-1
01:51:53.035 --> 01:51:56.777
<v John Miller>the ability to quickly produce a UI
that's got something that to show</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2028-2
01:51:56.777 --> 01:51:59.344
<v John Miller>something.
Even if the point of view all you're</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2028-3
01:51:59.344 --> 01:52:03.086
<v John Miller>doing is prototyping something,
this will get you to that prototype I</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2028-4
01:52:03.086 --> 01:52:06.935
<v John Miller>think a great deal faster than you were
doing if you do it on your own.</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2030-0
01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:11.335
<v John Miller>All right. Any questions on this?</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2033-0
01:52:16.095 --> 01:52:18.730
<v John Miller>All right, well,
let's take a break for lunch,</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2033-1
01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:22.542
<v John Miller>and then when we come back,
we'll start to actually do some of this</v>

32b46a9d-ba7b-4cca-a822-bd8d06758f97/2033-2
01:52:22.542 --> 01:52:24.000
<v John Miller>Greenfield work ourselves.</v>
