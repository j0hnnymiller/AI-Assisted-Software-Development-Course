00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:07.654
<v John Miller>My code tapping e-mail address.
Just as a thing, if you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/14-1
00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:12.033
<v John Miller>feel free to speak up if you have any
questions. You know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/14-2
00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.932
<v John Miller>I'd be happy to stop and answer any
questions that that you have.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/19-0
00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:22.028
<v John Miller>But I'd like to 1st off, you know,
welcome you to the course and let's go</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/19-1
00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:26.455
<v John Miller>through a a brief introduction period.
I'd like to know a little bit more about</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/19-2
00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:29.665
<v John Miller>who you guys are and so if you could tell
me who you are,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/19-3
00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:34.148
<v John Miller>what you do and what you've done with the
A I tools and what you're expecting to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/19-4
00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:35.532
<v John Miller>learn in the next 5 days.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/24-0
00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:41.465
<v John Miller>I'll start out. As I said,
I'm a principal software developer at</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/24-1
00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:46.439
<v John Miller>Code Staffing.
What I do is I'm working primarily right</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/24-2
00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:53.012
<v John Miller>now on internal applications for code,
so this is a good basic basically.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/27-0
00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:56.380
<v John Miller>Interesting because it's a it's a new
code base for me.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/27-1
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.910
<v John Miller>So when we talk about legacy software
development is, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/27-2
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.825
<v John Miller>these are coming from, you know,
hard won stories of having to go into</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/27-3
00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:08.292
<v John Miller>code bases that I'm not familiar with and
actually having to make some progress.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/31-0
00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:11.501
<v John Miller>So what I've done with AI tools is quite
a quite a bit.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/31-1
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.693
<v John Miller>I think as you'll see in as we get into
the the brownfield and the Greenfield</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/31-2
00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:19.939
<v John Miller>portions of the course is put a quite a
bit of effort into trying to make this</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/31-3
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.110
<v John Miller>more, make, make,
make it more productive and make it more</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/31-4
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.292
<v John Miller>reliable of a process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/35-0
00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:28.723
<v John Miller>And what I want to learn on the course is,
you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/35-1
00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:34.995
<v John Miller>how I can improve this course and make it
more relevant for other people. So, Peter,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/35-2
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.652
<v John Miller>would you would you like to go next?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/40-0
00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:45.776
<v Majernik, Peter>Sure, my name is Peter Vjernik.
I'm a software engineer and I would like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/40-1
00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:51.332
<v Majernik, Peter>to learn everything I can about how to
use GitHub Copilot properly.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/39-0
00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:53.092
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/41-0
00:01:53.172 --> 00:01:54.012
<v Majernik, Peter>That's it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/42-0
00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:56.092
<v John Miller>All right, uh, Jake.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/47-0
00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:05.665
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, I'm Jake. I'm a systems engineer.
I've used AI tools mostly just like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/47-1
00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:09.959
<v Carter, Jake>prompting LM's,
but I've never used like an integrated</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/47-2
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.502
<v Carter, Jake>IDE AI tool like this. So yeah,
just wanna sort of see how that that's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/47-3
00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:15.892
<v Carter, Jake>used.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/50-0
00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:21.047
<v John Miller>All right.
And we'll get some good experience out</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/50-1
00:02:21.047 --> 00:02:23.132
<v John Miller>that after lunch today, Seth.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/56-0
00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:29.628
<v Tarrants, Seth>So I'm Seth Terence.
I am the verification automation</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/56-1
00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:33.126
<v Tarrants, Seth>architect.
I've got background in building test</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/56-2
00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Tarrants, Seth>cases,
test automation frameworks and also</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/56-3
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.852
<v Tarrants, Seth>working with teams to just build process
and focus on quality.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/60-0
00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:46.642
<v Tarrants, Seth>Currently I'm just playing around with AI,
trying to figure out how I can utilize it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/60-1
00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:51.292
<v Tarrants, Seth>to help speed up my ability to analyze
and build out verification systems.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/62-0
00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:55.939
<v John Miller>Oh, so you'll be the,
you'll be the guy to make sure that we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/62-1
00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.772
<v John Miller>have enough tough cut test coverage then,
right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/63-0
00:02:58.052 --> 00:03:01.732
<v Tarrants, Seth>Uh, hopefully it's not just me.
Hopefully it's everybody. But yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/65-0
00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:01.852
<v John Miller>Yeah. All right. Uh, Mike.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/70-0
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:11.242
<v Harding, Mike>So Mike Harding, I'm a systems engineer.
I have very limited experience with AI</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/70-1
00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:15.135
<v Harding, Mike>tools other than some basic web-based
search stuff.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/70-2
00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:19.852
<v Harding, Mike>So just learning to see how this will
integrate with software.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/71-0
00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:22.052
<v Harding, Mike>Go from there.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/73-0
00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:23.652
<v John Miller>Right, right. Uh, Jan.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/79-0
00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Zhang, Yan>My name is Ian.
My job is mainly about to write C# code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/79-1
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.227
<v Zhang, Yan>in our application. And yeah,
that's what I'll do.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/79-2
00:03:39.227 --> 00:03:43.172
<v Zhang, Yan>Why I'm my title is a software developer.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/80-0
00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:46.692
<v John Miller>All right. Thank you for that. And Tom.</v>

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:56.012
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Director of Product Development.
I I think I attended to join your your</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/85-1
00:03:56.012 --> 00:04:00.547
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>webinar and that's how I got connected
and inspired.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/85-2
00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:07.649
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>My objective is to instead of hiring army
of developers to to see if we could find</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/85-3
00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.932
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>innovative way.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/91-0
00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:14.951
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>With IA or AI assisted way of developing
software, there's a lot of buzzwords,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/91-1
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:20.327
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>but I'm looking forward to discover
what's actually feasible and possible</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/91-2
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:25.412
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>today and then if we stay in touch,
and I hope so we do, then we can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/94-0
00:04:25.612 --> 00:04:31.449
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Roll it out into more effective way to
not only develop but also verify and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/94-1
00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.212
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>deploy software into the product and the
market.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/100-0
00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:40.171
<v John Miller>Sounds sounds good. So thank you.
Thank you all for that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/95-0
00:04:38.932 --> 00:04:39.092
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/100-1
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.786
<v John Miller>Let's just talk about the the agenda for
today's course.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/100-2
00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:48.924
<v John Miller>I'll just start for the brief overview
and we'll talk about you know AI assisted</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/100-3
00:04:48.924 --> 00:04:52.857
<v John Miller>software development.
Then we'll get into a section that will</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/100-4
00:04:52.857 --> 00:04:56.092
<v John Miller>will basically go through how this whole
all this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/104-0
00:04:56.092 --> 00:05:01.295
<v John Miller>How these LLMS work for developing code
and take a look at the actual</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/104-1
00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:05.755
<v John Miller>architecture diagram.
We'll talk about actually what is the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/104-2
00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:10.735
<v John Miller>process that the LLM goes through in
order to actually write code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/104-3
00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:16.012
<v John Miller>Then we'll turn into a section where
we'll talk about how to consider.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/110-0
00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:20.326
<v John Miller>Using a copilot in an enterprise team,
this is really gonna deal with how to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/110-1
00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:24.920
<v John Miller>protect your IP and what are some of the
risks that you're gonna be facing as you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/110-2
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.609
<v John Miller>actually start to use it on a day-to-day
basis.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/110-3
00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:31.922
<v John Miller>Then we'll get into an overview of the
actual tool, how to get it installed,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/110-4
00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:35.732
<v John Miller>what does a chat window look like?
What are the different features?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/113-0
00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:41.062
<v John Miller>How we can actually use it on a
day-to-day basis and then we'll have a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/113-1
00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:46.682
<v John Miller>hands on section and then we're gonna get
into what I would call a vibe coding</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/113-2
00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:51.661
<v John Miller>section where we're going to
collaboratively work together on writing</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/113-3
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:52.372
<v John Miller>some code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/117-0
00:05:52.892 --> 00:05:58.198
<v John Miller>That will that we can write in some code
and see how how far we can get in the the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/117-1
00:05:58.198 --> 00:06:03.248
<v John Miller>time that we have in the rest of the day
towards implementing something that's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/117-2
00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:06.252
<v John Miller>actually working.
Any questions on the agenda?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-0
00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:09.180
<v Laurabeth Barker>One thing I wanted to just add, John,
real quick is we are recording the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-1
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.716
<v Laurabeth Barker>session.
We are more than happy to stop the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-2
00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.887
<v Laurabeth Barker>recording at any point.
If if there is some, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-3
00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:18.864
<v Laurabeth Barker>sensitive topics being discussed,
just let me or John just basically</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-4
00:06:18.864 --> 00:06:21.400
<v Laurabeth Barker>mention it. Hey,
can we stop the recording?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/121-5
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.052
<v Laurabeth Barker>We'll stop it and then we'll pick it back
up.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/122-0
00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:28.052
<v Laurabeth Barker>Just wanted to let everybody know that,
so thanks, John.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/124-0
00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:29.332
<v John Miller>Sure.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/129-0
00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:34.833
<v John Miller>All right, so course objective.
We want to understand how to manipulate</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/129-1
00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:38.639
<v John Miller>Copilot into successfully modifying
legacy code bases, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/129-2
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.367
<v John Miller>So we so the the idea here is that we're
not letting Copilot write the code,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/129-3
00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:47.972
<v John Miller>but we're using it to help us write write
better code and write it faster.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/133-0
00:06:48.532 --> 00:06:52.750
<v John Miller>So we're focusing on AI assistance,
which means that the AI will be helping</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/133-1
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.857
<v John Miller>us and as well as assisting the AI,
which is important because we need to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/133-2
00:06:56.857 --> 00:07:01.519
<v John Miller>provide as much help as we can to the A I
in order for us to get output that that's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/133-3
00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:04.682
<v John Miller>actually usable.
So there's less emphasis on the syntax.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/133-4
00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:08.012
<v John Miller>It really doesn't matter what language
they're going to be.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/137-0
00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:12.845
<v John Miller>Be using for the course as much as the
general concepts apply and it's more</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/137-1
00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:17.974
<v John Miller>emphasis on the architecture, the design,
the code quality, refactoring, testing,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/137-2
00:07:17.974 --> 00:07:20.913
<v John Miller>things.
Those become much more important as we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/137-3
00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:22.852
<v John Miller>move into an AI assisted world.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/139-0
00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:28.292
<v John Miller>So we want to strive for moving faster,
but with less risk.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/144-0
00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:34.423
<v John Miller>So why A I assisted software development?
It's it's, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/144-1
00:07:34.423 --> 00:07:39.134
<v John Miller>A I is obviously I think revolution
revolutionizing software development,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/144-2
00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:41.998
<v John Miller>right.
It will ruin some careers and it will</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/144-3
00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:46.709
<v John Miller>revitalize others. So it was it's,
you know, in terms of ruining careers,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/144-4
00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:48.492
<v John Miller>it's I think it's basically.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/148-0
00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:53.067
<v John Miller>There's a an idea that that's been fairly
widely popularized.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/148-1
00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:57.938
<v John Miller>It's that it's not AI that's going to
replace you as a developer.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/148-2
00:07:57.938 --> 00:08:03.473
<v John Miller>It's going to be somebody that actually
can effectively utilize AI and so,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/148-3
00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:06.572
<v John Miller>but if you can effectively use utilize it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/152-0
00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:09.919
<v John Miller>In my my opinion,
it will give you superpowers because it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/152-1
00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.652
<v John Miller>really gives you the courage to take on
code bases that you would that few people</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/152-2
00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:19.211
<v John Miller>would ever touch or technologies that you
want to learn or and write more high</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/152-3
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:22.212
<v John Miller>quality code than any who have ever
written before.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/157-0
00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:26.564
<v John Miller>And then finally,
I think what I think is also important is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/157-1
00:08:26.564 --> 00:08:31.976
<v John Miller>that it's it's going to allow you to take
on more work as an organization than you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/157-2
00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:36.931
<v John Miller>would have been able to take on before
because you can actually have the AI</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/157-3
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:40.778
<v John Miller>allow you to take on some of the,
you know, nice to haves.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/157-4
00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:42.212
<v John Miller>The idea here is that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/161-0
00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:49.340
<v John Miller>I I'm sure you all have a a softer you
have a backlog in your that you that you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/161-1
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.083
<v John Miller>of items that you want to get to and
those are all prioritized by must haves</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/161-2
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:59.932
<v John Miller>and nice to haves and things that you
probably won't get to and.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/166-0
00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:04.439
<v John Miller>In my experience,
we very rarely get to the nice to haves.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/166-1
00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:09.974
<v John Miller>It's always something more important than
those that actually gets attention.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/166-2
00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:15.793
<v John Miller>But I think that the things on the nice
to haves list are usually the things that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/166-3
00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:17.212
<v John Miller>really had a lot of.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-0
00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:19.703
<v John Miller>Value,
but they're not really directly</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-1
00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:22.362
<v John Miller>applicable,
applicable to the main line of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-2
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:25.577
<v John Miller>development.
So being able to take on those nice to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-3
00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:29.782
<v John Miller>haves really opens up software
development to a whole wide range of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-4
00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:34.481
<v John Miller>opportunities to implement things that we
just never really had the time to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/170-5
00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.532
<v John Miller>implement before.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-0
00:09:37.932 --> 00:09:41.100
<v John Miller>All right.
So let's get into a just an introduction</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-1
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.328
<v John Miller>of what an LLM is.
So we'll talk about what a large,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-2
00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:48.776
<v John Miller>these are large language models.
We'll do a conceptual overview how they</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-3
00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:51.578
<v John Miller>work.
We'll talk about their capabilities and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-4
00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:54.746
<v John Miller>limitations,
software engineering with AI as a tool</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/175-5
00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:55.172
<v John Miller>versus.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/179-0
00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:59.238
<v John Miller>What you know by coding and then we'll
get into some do's and don'ts.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/179-1
00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:03.184
<v John Miller>Just to kind of reiterate the overview,
the first part of the course,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/179-2
00:10:03.184 --> 00:10:07.299
<v John Miller>the first I think before lunch,
we're going to be spending a lot of time</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/179-3
00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:11.132
<v John Miller>just discussing what the what what we're
trying to accomplish here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/182-0
00:10:11.172 --> 00:10:16.387
<v John Miller>And then the then after lunch we'll get
into a lot more exercises in in working</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/182-1
00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:19.516
<v John Miller>with the tools. So first,
so a conceptual view.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/182-2
00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:24.665
<v John Miller>LLNS are trained on massive data sets,
right? And these are data sets of code,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/182-3
00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:27.012
<v John Miller>so you can pretty much imagine that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/188-0
00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:33.700
<v John Miller>All of the code that people have put into
get into into GitHub or or other code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/188-1
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.996
<v John Miller>repositories.
These have all been used to change to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/188-2
00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:44.109
<v John Miller>train these models as in the training
process there's an effort to try to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/188-3
00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:44.852
<v John Miller>identify.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/192-0
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:50.277
<v John Miller>Or prioritize the value of the data so
that they're trying to train these on the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/192-1
00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:55.703
<v John Miller>most on the on the best examples of of
code and not just all of them in general.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/192-2
00:10:55.703 --> 00:11:00.860
<v John Miller>They use what's called a transformer
architect to understand the patterns in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/192-3
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.932
<v John Miller>the code itself.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/197-0
00:11:02.212 --> 00:11:06.734
<v John Miller>And then it uses token based processing
where the code is broken down into tokens.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/197-1
00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:11.148
<v John Miller>And we'll talk about tokens in a little
bit because it's something that you have</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/197-2
00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:14.853
<v John Miller>to kind of pay attention to.
And this something called an attention</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/197-3
00:11:14.853 --> 00:11:19.212
<v John Miller>mechanism helps the models focus on the
relevant parts of the context. So it's.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-0
00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:23.981
<v John Miller>It's reading your code base,
it's reading the context in which you've</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-1
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:26.754
<v John Miller>given it in terms of describing what you
want,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-2
00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:30.883
<v John Miller>and it's turning that into and it's
prioritizing that in terms of the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-3
00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:34.364
<v John Miller>attention mechanism.
So it's focusing on the most relevant</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-4
00:11:34.364 --> 00:11:38.729
<v John Miller>parts in order to try to produce
something that's actually closer to what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/202-5
00:11:38.729 --> 00:11:39.732
<v John Miller>you're expecting.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/206-0
00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:44.956
<v John Miller>And then it generates A probabilistic
next token predictions based on those</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/206-1
00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:48.461
<v John Miller>training patterns.
So it's not true understanding.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/206-2
00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:51.966
<v John Miller>It's pattern matching at a very,
very large scale.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/206-3
00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:55.747
<v John Miller>So if we mention understanding anywhere
in the course,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/206-4
00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:59.252
<v John Miller>we're really not talking about
understanding in a.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/211-0
00:11:59.332 --> 00:12:03.341
<v John Miller>Conceptual sense.
We're talking about understanding in a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/211-1
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:08.264
<v John Miller>more of a statistical analysis sense and
a predictive analytic sense,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/211-2
00:12:08.264 --> 00:12:13.961
<v John Miller>where it's trying to first to try to to
understand by tokenizing what you're the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/211-3
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.532
<v John Miller>context that you're giving it,
and then it's using that context.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/213-0
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:23.292
<v John Miller>In order to predict what the most likely
next, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/213-1
00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:27.972
<v John Miller>next piece of code should be.
Any any questions on this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/219-0
00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:34.768
<v John Miller>Alrighty, so capabilities,
code completion and general and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/219-1
00:12:34.768 --> 00:12:40.255
<v John Miller>generation from natural language.
You can refactor code and optimize code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/219-2
00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:45.229
<v John Miller>You can detect bugs and and fix finding
and fixing recommendations.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/219-3
00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:49.692
<v John Miller>You can generate documentation.
You can generate test cases.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/222-0
00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:55.720
<v John Miller>You can use it to just explain to you the
how you know what is going on with the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/222-1
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.528
<v John Miller>code with code.
You know one of my favorite examples of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/222-2
00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:05.172
<v John Miller>this is is deciphering regex expressions.
You know it's certain it's not my Forte.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-0
00:13:06.132 --> 00:13:08.708
<v John Miller>In terms of interpreting something like
that,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-1
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.228
<v John Miller>but if you just ask a copilot to explain
it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-2
00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:13.804
<v John Miller>it will it will break it down very
precisely,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-3
00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:17.276
<v John Miller>characterize our character and explain it,
explain it to you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-4
00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:21.644
<v John Miller>Great tool for learning a code base or
learning code that you're not familiar</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/227-5
00:13:21.644 --> 00:13:22.372
<v John Miller>with is just.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/231-0
00:13:22.892 --> 00:13:27.722
<v John Miller>Have the AI explain it and then you can
augment that with actually commenting the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/231-1
00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:30.667
<v John Miller>code itself,
generating documentation and you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/231-2
00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:35.438
<v John Miller>actually do a multi languages board and
we're talking about coding language here</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/231-3
00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:39.030
<v John Miller>where it will translate.
You can ask it to translate between</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/231-4
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.092
<v John Miller>languages so you can say take this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/233-0
00:13:41.412 --> 00:13:47.014
<v John Miller>This example that's in written in Go and
turn it into C# code or or or go the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/233-1
00:13:47.014 --> 00:13:47.732
<v John Miller>other way.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/238-0
00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:53.998
<v John Miller>So some limitations,
no real knowledge updates.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/238-1
00:13:53.998 --> 00:14:01.534
<v John Miller>What this means is that all of these LNMS
are based on a static set of of data that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/238-2
00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:05.212
<v John Miller>was accurate as of as of a point in time.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/242-0
00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:09.343
<v John Miller>And so they also,
so they don't really understand anything</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/242-1
00:14:09.343 --> 00:14:13.944
<v John Miller>that's happened since that that training
date in some some of the data.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/242-2
00:14:13.944 --> 00:14:19.120
<v John Miller>It can be a year or 18 months old before
they have an opportunity to retrain the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/242-3
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.252
<v John Miller>model so that you get more accurate
information.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/247-0
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:26.703
<v John Miller>That's for code generation.
It's not as big of a problem because</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/247-1
00:14:26.703 --> 00:14:31.297
<v John Miller>we're not really asking it current facts.
We're really saying, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/247-2
00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:34.947
<v John Miller>can you write some code that can do this?
But it will be,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/247-3
00:14:34.947 --> 00:14:38.408
<v John Miller>it will affect us in terms of knowing
things like, oh,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/247-4
00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:41.492
<v John Miller>what is the most recent version of
something or.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/251-0
00:14:41.972 --> 00:14:46.573
<v John Miller>Dealing with anything that's a temporal
data that's recent,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/251-1
00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:51.710
<v John Miller>you can generate syntactically correct
code, but logically flawed.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/251-2
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:57.692
<v John Miller>So I've seen lots of examples of this
where I've asked it to do something and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/251-3
00:14:57.692 --> 00:14:59.532
<v John Miller>it'll produce something.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/255-0
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:05.489
<v John Miller>That it that it says is correct,
but you run it and it doesn't work.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/255-1
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:10.746
<v John Miller>I'm sure you've all heard about
hallucinations with, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/255-2
00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:15.252
<v John Miller>where it's it inserts that something is
true, but it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/260-0
00:15:15.412 --> 00:15:20.853
<v John Miller>But incorrectly suggests something else.
We'll talk about some strategies for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/260-1
00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:25.107
<v John Miller>dealing with that,
and generally the whole idea is to try to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/260-2
00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:30.618
<v John Miller>provide very concrete instructions.
There are some context window limitations.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/260-3
00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:35.012
<v John Miller>It's a finite amount of memory that the
Copilot has available.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/264-0
00:15:35.212 --> 00:15:40.353
<v John Miller>In order for it to be able to understand
and predict when you start to exceed that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/264-1
00:15:40.353 --> 00:15:43.945
<v John Miller>context window,
it starts to forget things and you'll see</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/264-2
00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:48.962
<v John Miller>it actually repeat itself or not having
to go and try to re understand some code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/264-3
00:15:48.962 --> 00:15:50.572
<v John Miller>that it's already written.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/268-0
00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:54.108
<v John Miller>And again,
it doesn't understand business logic or</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/268-1
00:15:54.108 --> 00:15:58.466
<v John Miller>domain specific requirements.
It can just use the context in order to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/268-2
00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:03.198
<v John Miller>predict what it thinks that the next
piece of code should be or the actual,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/268-3
00:16:03.198 --> 00:16:08.429
<v John Miller>you know, string of characters should be.
It's it's really that it's very that that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/268-4
00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:10.172
<v John Miller>that low level of a process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/272-0
00:16:10.812 --> 00:16:15.643
<v John Miller>And security vulnerables are are not
reviewed unless they explicitly ask for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/272-1
00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:19.721
<v John Miller>those types of things.
And so you have to also be careful about,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/272-2
00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:22.732
<v John Miller>you know,
introducing security issues into your</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/272-3
00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:25.932
<v John Miller>code and take steps to actually mitigate
for that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-0
00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:31.046
<v John Miller>And the last point here is that there can
be bias from the training data. It can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-1
00:16:31.046 --> 00:16:33.220
<v John Miller>It only understands what it's been
trained on,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-2
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.829
<v John Miller>and if it hasn't been trained on the
programming language that you're working</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-3
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.633
<v John Miller>on,
or for the examples that it's been</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-4
00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:42.149
<v John Miller>trained on are not the best examples,
then you're not going to get the best</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/277-5
00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:44.092
<v John Miller>outcome. It it is the, you know, standard.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/279-0
00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:50.652
<v John Miller>Computer garbage in, garbage out scenario.
It's just scaled up.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/280-0
00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:53.772
<v John Miller>Any questions?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/286-0
00:16:55.412 --> 00:16:58.882
<v John Miller>All right.
So what we really want to talk about is I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/286-1
00:16:58.882 --> 00:17:01.959
<v John Miller>think software engineering versus Vibe
coding.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/286-2
00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:04.839
<v John Miller>So Vibe coding is basically in the
process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/286-3
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:10.011
<v John Miller>So you just you give it the prompts and
you take the results and then you just</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/286-4
00:17:10.011 --> 00:17:14.332
<v John Miller>continue to iterate on that.
You can have some success with that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/290-0
00:17:14.612 --> 00:17:18.173
<v John Miller>But in a a large environment with a large
code base,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/290-1
00:17:18.173 --> 00:17:23.480
<v John Miller>you really need to take a more of an
engineering approach which is systematic,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/290-2
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.720
<v John Miller>tested, documented and maintainable.
While you know, I guess I said it works,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/290-3
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.012
<v John Miller>you end up with a a technical debt
accumulation.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/294-0
00:17:32.372 --> 00:17:36.481
<v John Miller>So AI think of it in terms of AI
enhancing our engineering practices,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/294-1
00:17:36.481 --> 00:17:40.063
<v John Miller>but not replacing them.
You still need to do proper testing,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/294-2
00:17:40.063 --> 00:17:43.761
<v John Miller>code reviews, architecture.
It's all still essential. In fact,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/294-3
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:47.812
<v John Miller>I think because AI is going to be
producing so much additional code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/296-0
00:17:48.212 --> 00:17:53.470
<v John Miller>These these these particular skills I
think are are even more essential than</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/296-1
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.972
<v John Miller>they were in the past.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/301-0
00:17:56.532 --> 00:18:01.252
<v John Miller>So some do's always review and test the
AI generated code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/301-1
00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:07.012
<v John Miller>So you know that goes back to in terms of
maintaining our code quality.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/301-2
00:18:07.012 --> 00:18:13.332
<v John Miller>Want to make sure that that the not just
the code works, but that the code is,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/301-3
00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:16.052
<v John Miller>you know, good clean code that we.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/304-0
00:18:16.052 --> 00:18:18.984
<v John Miller>Yeah,
equivalent to what we would actually</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/304-1
00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:23.279
<v John Miller>write ourselves. Provide clear,
specific prompts with context.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/304-2
00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:25.052
<v John Miller>We'll spend a lot of time.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/309-0
00:18:26.132 --> 00:18:31.885
<v John Miller>Trying to provide that context with our
when we were actually asking it to write</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/309-1
00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:37.497
<v John Miller>code and and there's several different
ways that we can do this and I think if</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/309-2
00:18:37.497 --> 00:18:43.250
<v John Miller>we when we the more that we can provide
good context that's clear the the better</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/309-3
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.452
<v John Miller>output that we're going to see.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/313-0
00:18:46.772 --> 00:18:51.090
<v John Miller>You can you can use AI to explore
different implementation approaches.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/313-1
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.313
<v John Miller>This is actually something I can show
fairly easily,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/313-2
00:18:54.313 --> 00:18:59.057
<v John Miller>and you can then where we can actually
ask two different AIS to implement the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/313-3
00:18:59.057 --> 00:19:03.740
<v John Miller>same approach and then ask the third AI
to give us the pros and cons of each</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/313-4
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.652
<v John Miller>implementation.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/318-0
00:19:05.532 --> 00:19:10.953
<v John Miller>And then we can use that information to
make a decision about where we actually</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/318-1
00:19:10.953 --> 00:19:16.306
<v John Miller>want to take the take the implementation.
And of course we can leverage AI for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/318-2
00:19:16.306 --> 00:19:20.236
<v John Miller>documentation and generating tests.
And in my experience,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/318-3
00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:23.692
<v John Miller>the test generation process is a bit hit
and miss.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/323-0
00:19:24.452 --> 00:19:29.471
<v John Miller>In that it will generate a test,
but many times the test won't work and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/323-1
00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:34.700
<v John Miller>then it will then go through a cycle of
iterating on that test in order to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/323-2
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.626
<v John Miller>improve it and finally get it to function.
I've seen it not fail to generate a test,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/323-3
00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:43.972
<v John Miller>but take several iterations to go and
actually.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/325-0
00:19:44.052 --> 00:19:48.372
<v John Miller>We find and produce that test and as a
code base gets more complicated that that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/325-1
00:19:48.372 --> 00:19:50.932
<v John Miller>process gets a little more complicated as
well.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/330-0
00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:58.578
<v John Miller>Some some don'ts blindly accept AI
suggestions, right? We just yeah,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/330-1
00:19:58.578 --> 00:20:05.256
<v John Miller>we've heard stories from other industries
where people have taken those suggestions</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/330-2
00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:11.139
<v John Miller>and and really cause problems for
themselves because they didn't actually</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/330-3
00:20:11.139 --> 00:20:12.332
<v John Miller>review the the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/334-0
00:20:12.372 --> 00:20:16.471
<v John Miller>What AI had suggested.
We don't want to skip the testing because</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/334-1
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.003
<v John Miller>AI wrote it.
That's certainly not going to be the case.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/334-2
00:20:20.003 --> 00:20:23.850
<v John Miller>We we want to use AI for critical source,
critical security,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/334-3
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.012
<v John Miller>a safety critical code without extensive
validation of that code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/339-0
00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:33.158
<v John Miller>You know, to me it's like, you know,
you you first want to set your</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/339-1
00:20:33.158 --> 00:20:38.625
<v John Miller>environment up so where those critical
security and safety critical issues are</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/339-2
00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:44.092
<v John Miller>called out in advance in terms of how the
A I should be handling those things.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/344-0
00:20:44.332 --> 00:20:49.863
<v John Miller>And then do an extensive review
afterwards to to verify that and then do</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/344-1
00:20:49.863 --> 00:20:55.622
<v John Miller>your standard security scanning and
testing in order to be able to identify</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/344-2
00:20:55.622 --> 00:21:01.153
<v John Miller>any uses that come out the other end.
Rely AI on architectural decisions</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/344-3
00:21:01.153 --> 00:21:02.972
<v John Miller>without human oversight.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/349-0
00:21:03.812 --> 00:21:09.063
<v John Miller>One of the things that I think is a real
benefit of using AI is that you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/349-1
00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:14.723
<v John Miller>surface these architectural decisions and
you can then reach a decision as a group</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/349-2
00:21:14.723 --> 00:21:20.383
<v John Miller>about how you want to approach them as we
get farther into the course tomorrow and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/349-3
00:21:20.383 --> 00:21:23.452
<v John Miller>the next day and we'll be doing quite a
lot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/352-0
00:21:23.492 --> 00:21:29.030
<v John Miller>About providing context into the into the
models and and then which provides us</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/352-1
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:34.223
<v John Miller>with a great deal of a real good
opportunity for us to actually agree upon</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/352-2
00:21:34.223 --> 00:21:37.892
<v John Miller>what what is the right way of approaching
a problem.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/357-0
00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:45.712
<v John Miller>And of course you know generate code
without understanding the the logic.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/357-1
00:21:45.712 --> 00:21:53.301
<v John Miller>You know AI can help you with with with
that process quite a bit with as I as I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/357-2
00:21:53.301 --> 00:21:56.052
<v John Miller>said about explaining things.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/360-0
00:21:56.252 --> 00:22:00.586
<v John Miller>The idea here is that there should be no
reason that you should look at a piece of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/360-1
00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:04.816
<v John Miller>code and not understand what it is when
AI can tell you exactly what it does and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/360-2
00:22:04.816 --> 00:22:07.532
<v John Miller>break it down piece by piece and explain
it to you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/362-0
00:22:11.092 --> 00:22:13.690
<v John Miller>All right,
let's take a look at a architecture</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/362-1
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.132
<v John Miller>diagram.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/369-0
00:22:27.132 --> 00:22:35.052
<v John Miller>This kind of goes through the process of
of producing some code with with an LNM.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/374-0
00:22:36.932 --> 00:22:42.035
<v John Miller>This this diagram was produced by an LLM.
I've reviewed it and it it looks</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/374-1
00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:46.321
<v John Miller>perfectly fine to me.
But if this is generating these kinds of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/374-2
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:51.696
<v John Miller>diagrams is something I'll show and we'll
talk about a little bit later in the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/374-3
00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:52.172
<v John Miller>course.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/378-0
00:22:52.812 --> 00:22:57.863
<v John Miller>So the idea is we start with some
developer input and we come in natural</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/378-1
00:22:57.863 --> 00:23:03.399
<v John Miller>language and we add that with some code
context and that gives the the elements</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/378-2
00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:09.212
<v John Miller>some sense of what the actual code looks
like and what you're trying to accomplish.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/382-0
00:23:09.492 --> 00:23:14.607
<v John Miller>Then basically we go through a
tokenization step which takes that text</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/382-1
00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:18.857
<v John Miller>and turns it into tokens.
It breaks it down into words and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/382-2
00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:24.332
<v John Miller>characters in a tokenized format that
makes the model easier to understand.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/386-0
00:23:24.372 --> 00:23:29.156
<v John Miller>Then there's an embedding layer where
those tokens are turned into vectors,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/386-1
00:23:29.156 --> 00:23:34.382
<v John Miller>and then there's a transform layer which
is and that where that self attention and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/386-2
00:23:34.382 --> 00:23:38.599
<v John Miller>feed forward comes back.
This is like where the real magic happens</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/386-3
00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:39.292
<v John Miller>that takes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-0
00:23:39.412 --> 00:23:42.425
<v John Miller>The tokens that you've given it in terms
of the context,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-1
00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:46.602
<v John Miller>it adds the training data and the code
repositories and the documentation that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-2
00:23:46.602 --> 00:23:50.779
<v John Miller>it understands and then there are some
fine tuning code specific training that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-3
00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:53.739
<v John Miller>it gets done.
That happens at the back end in the model</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-4
00:23:53.739 --> 00:23:57.282
<v John Miller>to try to improve the performance of the
model in generating code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/392-5
00:23:57.282 --> 00:23:59.132
<v John Miller>All of that gets combined together.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/397-0
00:23:59.332 --> 00:24:04.927
<v John Miller>Into a context window and which is that
limited memory buffer which then goes to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/397-1
00:24:04.927 --> 00:24:10.523
<v John Miller>the the pattern recognition step and the
code patterns and syntax understanding.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/397-2
00:24:10.523 --> 00:24:15.427
<v John Miller>Then then there the the probability
distribution occurs which tries to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/397-3
00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:18.052
<v John Miller>predict what the next token should be.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/400-0
00:24:18.132 --> 00:24:23.343
<v John Miller>Then there's a decoding strategy,
which then turns the tokens back into.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/400-1
00:24:23.343 --> 00:24:28.555
<v John Miller>Basically that's a strategy search in
terms of what should be generated.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/400-2
00:24:28.555 --> 00:24:34.052
<v John Miller>Then there's the cogeneration portion,
which turns the token back into text.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/405-0
00:24:34.132 --> 00:24:39.025
<v John Miller>And then there's a post-processing syntax
validation that the models do again to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/405-1
00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:43.436
<v John Miller>try to catch for to catch errors.
And finally you get the you get to see</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/405-2
00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:46.879
<v John Miller>the code and you get to validate it.
If it's acceptable,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/405-3
00:24:46.879 --> 00:24:50.927
<v John Miller>you can then keep the code,
otherwise you can refine the prompt in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/405-4
00:24:50.927 --> 00:24:51.652
<v John Miller>the context.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/407-0
00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:58.292
<v John Miller>And go all the way back to the top and
try it again. Any questions on that?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/409-0
00:24:59.252 --> 00:25:03.577
<v John Miller>You see me looking over to my left.
It's because that's where I have the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/409-1
00:25:03.577 --> 00:25:03.932
<v John Miller>teams.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/412-0
00:25:04.372 --> 00:25:07.666
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, I have a question.
Can you scroll back up to the top?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/411-0
00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:09.132
<v John Miller>Sure, go ahead. Sure.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/412-1
00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:09.532
<v Carter, Jake>Can you scroll back up to the top?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/418-0
00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:14.927
<v Carter, Jake>This like fine tuning code specific
training.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/418-1
00:25:14.927 --> 00:25:19.364
<v Carter, Jake>Is this like like specifically in the
context of using GitHub Copilot?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/418-2
00:25:19.364 --> 00:25:22.364
<v Carter, Jake>Cause like you know you like select your
model,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/418-3
00:25:22.364 --> 00:25:27.052
<v Carter, Jake>is that does that like tell the model
that you're sort of using in a code?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/420-0
00:25:27.772 --> 00:25:32.474
<v Carter, Jake>Like a coding like you're using it for
writing code, I guess.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/420-1
00:25:32.474 --> 00:25:35.052
<v Carter, Jake>Is that what that is specifically?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/424-0
00:25:35.612 --> 00:25:39.014
<v John Miller>Yeah,
it's that and it's also you know language</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/424-1
00:25:39.014 --> 00:25:42.488
<v John Miller>specific fine tuning that's done the the
models,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/424-2
00:25:42.488 --> 00:25:47.733
<v John Miller>the models are tweaked in terms of what
what is in terms of priorities of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/424-3
00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:50.852
<v John Miller>different aspects of of the model.
So they.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/428-0
00:25:50.932 --> 00:25:55.016
<v John Miller>When they're building the models,
they tweak those in order to try to to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/428-1
00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:58.428
<v John Miller>improve the output.
And so that this fine tuning is going to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/428-2
00:25:58.428 --> 00:26:01.953
<v John Miller>be not just, you know,
the fact that you're actually trying to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/428-3
00:26:01.953 --> 00:26:04.806
<v John Miller>write code,
it'll be what language you're actually</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/428-4
00:26:04.806 --> 00:26:06.652
<v John Miller>using and it'll be fine-tuned to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/433-0
00:26:06.852 --> 00:26:13.162
<v John Miller>For for that purpose it'll all be also be
fine-tuned on you know coding practices</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/433-1
00:26:13.162 --> 00:26:18.780
<v John Miller>and and things like that you know in
order to try to improve the the the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/433-2
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.012
<v John Miller>quality of the code that it writes and so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/435-0
00:26:20.452 --> 00:26:24.812
<v Carter, Jake>So this this is something that. Sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/437-0
00:26:24.532 --> 00:26:27.938
<v John Miller>No, I think I know what your question is.
This is something that happens on the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/437-1
00:26:27.938 --> 00:26:30.706
<v John Miller>back end and the model.
This is not something that you do in the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/437-2
00:26:30.706 --> 00:26:31.132
<v John Miller>front end.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/443-0
00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:34.208
<v Carter, Jake>But well, my question is,
is this something that like GitHub</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/443-1
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:37.313
<v Carter, Jake>copilot or is it like GitHub adds like on
top of the model?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/443-2
00:26:37.313 --> 00:26:41.349
<v Carter, Jake>Or this is something that like say you're
using like one of Open AI's models,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/439-0
00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:37.612
<v John Miller>No.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/443-3
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:44.764
<v Carter, Jake>Open AI would use this. OK,
so this this probably isn't something</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/441-0
00:26:42.052 --> 00:26:44.892
<v John Miller>Right, right, right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/443-4
00:26:44.764 --> 00:26:47.092
<v Carter, Jake>that you could like customize yourself
then.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-0
00:26:47.892 --> 00:26:50.828
<v John Miller>No, no, no.
And there's a lot of effort to try to in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-1
00:26:50.828 --> 00:26:54.263
<v John Miller>some circles to try to try and expose and
make some of these.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-2
00:26:54.263 --> 00:26:57.034
<v John Miller>I think it's like at the top they call
weighting.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-3
00:26:57.034 --> 00:27:01.521
<v John Miller>They like like weight certain aspects of
the model to make that more transparent</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-4
00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:04.292
<v John Miller>to you,
but it is something that's baked into the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/448-5
00:27:04.292 --> 00:27:05.012
<v John Miller>model itself.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/447-0
00:27:05.172 --> 00:27:06.532
<v Carter, Jake>OK, that makes sense.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/451-0
00:27:08.412 --> 00:27:10.092
<v Majernik, Peter>John, can I ask a question?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/450-0
00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:09.092
<v John Miller>Other.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/452-0
00:27:10.612 --> 00:27:11.612
<v John Miller>Yeah, of course.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/455-0
00:27:11.572 --> 00:27:16.031
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, so if I'm not a data scientist,
how do I know which model to pick for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/455-1
00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:16.332
<v Majernik, Peter>what?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/462-0
00:27:19.412 --> 00:27:24.394
<v John Miller>Well, that's a good question.
I didn't create a slide for this,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/462-1
00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:29.455
<v John Miller>but I probably should.
But if you do a search or a copilot query</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/462-2
00:27:29.455 --> 00:27:35.994
<v John Miller>for model comparisons for generating code,
there's a couple of sites out there that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/462-3
00:27:35.994 --> 00:27:38.252
<v John Miller>that's where they make their.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/466-0
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:44.084
<v John Miller>That's our purpose is is that they take a
whole series of code generation prompts</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/466-1
00:27:44.084 --> 00:27:49.278
<v John Miller>and they run them through each of the
models and then they evaluate the output</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/466-2
00:27:49.278 --> 00:27:54.012
<v John Miller>and and rank the models based on how they
perform in different aspects.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/470-0
00:27:55.252 --> 00:28:02.339
<v John Miller>Right and right. Oh,
at least up until most recently,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/470-1
00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:12.052
<v John Miller>the the the leader in that area was it
was Claude Sonnet 4.5 but copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/472-0
00:28:12.452 --> 00:28:18.052
<v John Miller>Chachi B Chachi DB5 is starting to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/477-0
00:28:19.012 --> 00:28:24.460
<v John Miller>To come out on top on some of these
coding exercises.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/477-1
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:32.227
<v John Miller>So there's a real competition in the
coding space because coding is 1 use of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/477-2
00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:35.052
<v John Miller>AI that is really taken off.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/481-0
00:28:37.892 --> 00:28:41.231
<v John Miller>You know,
I've seen reports where in in the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/481-1
00:28:41.231 --> 00:28:47.453
<v John Miller>consumer space things are are tending to
slow down because people are not willing</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/481-2
00:28:47.453 --> 00:28:53.372
<v John Miller>to pay for a an A I to do work for them
on the on the consumer space so much.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/485-0
00:28:53.812 --> 00:28:58.259
<v John Miller>But if you ask a room of developers,
more than half of them will raise their</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/485-1
00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:02.416
<v John Miller>hand that they're already paying for AI.
And you're honestly, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/485-2
00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:05.939
<v John Miller>I pay for it as well.
And and you guys are in the process of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/485-3
00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:10.328
<v John Miller>obtaining a license to edit a while
because it's a really valuable tool for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/485-4
00:29:10.328 --> 00:29:11.252
<v John Miller>code generation.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/486-0
00:29:13.252 --> 00:29:14.172
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/488-0
00:29:15.612 --> 00:29:15.772
<v John Miller>Sure.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/491-0
00:29:16.772 --> 00:29:20.431
<v John Miller>All right,
so now let's talk about considerations</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/491-1
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:24.383
<v John Miller>for adoption,
the idea empowering developers with a I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/491-2
00:29:24.383 --> 00:29:26.652
<v John Miller>while protecting the code base.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/495-0
00:29:28.692 --> 00:29:34.263
<v John Miller>So this is the prompt I used actually to
create this to create the white paper</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/495-1
00:29:34.263 --> 00:29:38.918
<v John Miller>that I distributed as well as the the
slide deck from that model.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/495-2
00:29:38.918 --> 00:29:43.572
<v John Miller>I reviewed it with a couple of people and
it looks it's accurate.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/500-0
00:29:44.172 --> 00:29:49.696
<v John Miller>So that I I basically I said I wanted to
know how GitHub Copilot protects this the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/500-1
00:29:49.696 --> 00:29:55.220
<v John Miller>intellectual property, the documentation.
I wanted to know if it was isolated from</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/500-2
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.615
<v John Miller>other users.
Is it incorporated into the model and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/500-3
00:29:58.615 --> 00:30:00.412
<v John Miller>then leaked to other users?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/505-0
00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.389
<v John Miller>How can I protect the IP while using
GitHub Copilot?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/505-1
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:09.541
<v John Miller>So this deck was based on that research.
So the benefits as we've been talking</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/505-2
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:14.628
<v John Miller>about are accelerated developments,
improved documentation, enhanced testing,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/505-3
00:30:14.628 --> 00:30:18.020
<v John Miller>team productivity.
All of this is on the plus side,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/505-4
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.172
<v John Miller>but we want to consider the risk.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/508-0
00:30:20.772 --> 00:30:23.894
<v John Miller>One of them is call one is referred to
leakage.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/508-1
00:30:23.894 --> 00:30:27.862
<v John Miller>We're co-piling message code similar to
public repositories.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/508-2
00:30:27.862 --> 00:30:33.000
<v John Miller>So something you have to be concerned
about is inadvertently using copyrighted</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/508-3
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.252
<v John Miller>or licensed code in your application
application.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/512-0
00:30:36.532 --> 00:30:41.901
<v John Miller>So there's a mitigation for that is
enabling public or called public code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/512-1
00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:45.383
<v John Miller>filters and review those suggestions
carefully.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/512-2
00:30:45.383 --> 00:30:50.752
<v John Miller>If you have the the enterprise model,
I believe the enterprise version of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/512-3
00:30:50.752 --> 00:30:51.332
<v John Miller>Copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/517-0
00:30:52.052 --> 00:30:57.064
<v John Miller>I'm not sure about the business version.
I don't recall it at the top of my head,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/517-1
00:30:57.064 --> 00:31:02.199
<v John Miller>but the enterprise version will indemnify
the organization from claims where you've</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/517-2
00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:06.600
<v John Miller>used copyrighted or license code,
which means that they will, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/517-3
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.612
<v John Miller>vouch for the fact that it's not licensed
or copyrighted and be able to stand up.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/521-0
00:31:11.812 --> 00:31:15.194
<v John Miller>In a state on why they believe that's so.
So there's a,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/521-1
00:31:15.194 --> 00:31:20.147
<v John Miller>but you have to turn that capability on.
So that's kind of an administrative task</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/521-2
00:31:20.147 --> 00:31:24.496
<v John Miller>when you are deploying copilot,
copilot in an organization is to enable</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/521-3
00:31:24.496 --> 00:31:26.852
<v John Miller>that if that's a concern that you have.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/525-0
00:31:26.932 --> 00:31:31.182
<v John Miller>And I think it's worthwhile to do that
just just for that indemnification.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/525-1
00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:35.829
<v John Miller>You also have to consider code quality
and accuracy. You know, we all know about,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/525-2
00:31:35.829 --> 00:31:38.492
<v John Miller>you know,
AI is since it's a predictive model,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/525-3
00:31:38.492 --> 00:31:41.892
<v John Miller>there's no guarantee it's going to
predict the right thing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/529-0
00:31:43.092 --> 00:31:46.446
<v John Miller>So it could contain contain bugs,
security flaws,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/529-1
00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:50.738
<v John Miller>all kinds of other kinds of issues that
you'll have to address.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/529-2
00:31:50.738 --> 00:31:55.165
<v John Miller>And so that so you always need to to
validate and test that code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/529-3
00:31:55.165 --> 00:32:00.732
<v John Miller>You keep treat Copilot as a drafting tool,
not as a necessarily a source of truth.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/533-0
00:32:01.092 --> 00:32:08.632
<v John Miller>You know, I I like to, I like to,
I like to consider Copilot as kind of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/533-1
00:32:08.632 --> 00:32:16.172
<v John Miller>like a junior developer that has a huge
body of knowledge on on coding.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/537-0
00:32:16.532 --> 00:32:20.358
<v John Miller>And is super productive,
but you have to manage them very</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/537-1
00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:23.326
<v John Miller>carefully.
You have to manage what they are,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/537-2
00:32:23.326 --> 00:32:28.406
<v John Miller>what you tell them and you have to manage
in terms of reviewing what they're</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/537-3
00:32:28.406 --> 00:32:31.572
<v John Miller>actually giving you back and there's a
risk of.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/542-0
00:32:31.772 --> 00:32:36.043
<v John Miller>You know,
falling into the vibe coding mode where</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/542-1
00:32:36.043 --> 00:32:42.363
<v John Miller>you are letting go of the actual
intellectual property and letting the AI</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/542-2
00:32:42.363 --> 00:32:48.342
<v John Miller>actually take on a larger role.
And you really need to stay on top of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/542-3
00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:51.332
<v John Miller>that because you can easily become.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/547-0
00:32:51.492 --> 00:32:56.668
<v John Miller>Overwhelmed with the amount of code it
will produce and so you need to kind of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/547-1
00:32:56.668 --> 00:33:02.040
<v John Miller>slow down in some cases and take a closer
look at what is actually being done and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/547-2
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:07.478
<v John Miller>what you're actually telling it to do and
not be afraid to abandon an approach and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/547-3
00:33:07.478 --> 00:33:11.212
<v John Miller>have it start over with more context in

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/548-0
00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:13.772
<v John Miller>Get you closer to the target that you're
trying to meet.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/549-0
00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:16.332
<v John Miller>Questions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/554-0
00:33:18.052 --> 00:33:20.750
<v John Miller>All right.
Governments and compliance risk.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/554-1
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:25.655
<v John Miller>So you may have regulatory compliance.
I'm sure you guys do that where you need</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/554-2
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:28.230
<v John Miller>to,
you need to meet in terms of the code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/554-3
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.541
<v John Miller>that you write.
So you you need to be able to enforce</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/554-4
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:35.772
<v John Miller>those coding practices and policies and
and get prepared for audits.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/555-0
00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:37.772
<v John Miller>I'll show you some techniques.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/557-0
00:33:38.252 --> 00:33:38.812
<v John Miller>Nick's um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/558-0
00:33:40.092 --> 00:33:42.372
<v John Miller>Tomorrow for actually logging.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/562-0
00:33:44.572 --> 00:33:51.125
<v John Miller>What the AI is is doing so that you can
have a a an on trail of all the work</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/562-1
00:33:51.125 --> 00:33:52.572
<v John Miller>that's been done.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/566-0
00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:56.535
<v John Miller>By the A I what the what prompts did you
use?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/566-1
00:33:56.535 --> 00:34:01.472
<v John Miller>What what models in a way you can figure
out what model you're using at the time</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/566-2
00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:06.409
<v John Miller>and what decisions were made at the and
what kind of context that you gave it in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/566-3
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:09.212
<v John Miller>order for you to to execute the

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/570-0
00:34:09.572 --> 00:34:13.200
<v John Miller>And then again,
I mentioned about the resembling code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/570-1
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.239
<v John Miller>under restrictive licenses and that you
know you need to be able to define</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/570-2
00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:23.681
<v John Miller>acceptable use policies and monitor for
compliance and AI can help you with with</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/570-3
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:25.092
<v John Miller>this as well. So you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/575-0
00:34:25.172 --> 00:34:31.131
<v John Miller>Couple of things, IP and data protection.
Your code is not used to retrain the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/575-1
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:34.827
<v John Miller>model.
That's with a lesser extent with the free</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/575-2
00:34:34.827 --> 00:34:40.559
<v John Miller>and the pro models and to a greater
extent with the business and enterprise</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/575-3
00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:43.652
<v John Miller>models. So you can configure the tool to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/580-0
00:34:43.692 --> 00:34:48.365
<v John Miller>And to say that none of the none of the
code that you've sent it can be used to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/580-1
00:34:48.365 --> 00:34:51.695
<v John Miller>train the model,
therefore it won't be able to leak back</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/580-2
00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:55.668
<v John Miller>to any other user in the future.
Suggestions are generated locally,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/580-3
00:34:55.668 --> 00:34:59.932
<v John Miller>so no code is shared unless feedback is
actually submitted to the model.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/584-0
00:35:00.492 --> 00:35:05.196
<v John Miller>There's no leakage between users.
Your private code is not exposed to to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/584-1
00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:07.968
<v John Miller>others,
and admins can disable suggestions</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/584-2
00:35:07.968 --> 00:35:12.994
<v John Miller>matching public code for added safety.
So this is also some some ways you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/584-3
00:35:12.994 --> 00:35:16.732
<v John Miller>essentially configure Copilot to make
sure that you know.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/586-0
00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:23.874
<v John Miller>It's it's like not putting you at
additional legal risk by using the tool.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/586-1
00:35:23.874 --> 00:35:25.492
<v John Miller>Questions on this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/592-0
00:35:28.892 --> 00:35:31.334
<v John Miller>All right,
so copilot may suggest code that's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/592-1
00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:34.094
<v John Miller>similar to open positive cop dot a couple
of times.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/592-2
00:35:34.094 --> 00:35:38.128
<v John Miller>So GitHub provides a filter to block
matching code in public and you should</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/592-3
00:35:38.128 --> 00:35:42.427
<v John Miller>review both the terms of service and the
privacy statement to make sure that you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/592-4
00:35:42.427 --> 00:35:45.612
<v John Miller>understand what those licensing and legal
requirements are.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-0
00:35:48.492 --> 00:35:51.273
<v John Miller>All right.
So we mentioned the different versions of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-1
00:35:51.273 --> 00:35:53.581
<v John Miller>it.
This is talking about the IP protection</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-2
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:56.519
<v John Miller>for each of them.
The individual licenses have no admin</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-3
00:35:56.519 --> 00:35:59.877
<v John Miller>controls and it's limited IP protection.
So there is, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-4
00:35:59.877 --> 00:36:02.290
<v John Miller>there is a chance that some of that could
go,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-5
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.645
<v John Miller>should could trickle back into the model
and eventually show up on somebody else's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/597-6
00:36:06.645 --> 00:36:07.012
<v John Miller>screen.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/600-0
00:36:07.372 --> 00:36:12.463
<v John Miller>Copilot for Business has admin controls
and policy informers which are strong and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/600-1
00:36:12.463 --> 00:36:17.367
<v John Miller>the enterprises that has the strongest
organis org-wide policy and audit tools</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/600-2
00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:19.292
<v John Miller>that you can take advantage of.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/605-0
00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:25.813
<v John Miller>So just some best practices.
So enable those public code filters and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/605-1
00:36:25.813 --> 00:36:29.176
<v John Miller>and then do those suggestions before
committing the code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/605-2
00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:33.816
<v John Miller>So those are I think is good programming.
If the review is going to programming</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/605-3
00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:38.165
<v John Miller>practice and then we want to educate
teams like we're talking about now on</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/605-4
00:36:38.165 --> 00:36:41.412
<v John Miller>that responsibility use and being aware
of the license.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/610-0
00:36:43.132 --> 00:36:47.716
<v John Miller>The more resources to take a look at is
the copilot documentation.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/610-1
00:36:47.716 --> 00:36:53.258
<v John Miller>There's a copilot for business overview
documentation and a security privacy FAQ</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/610-2
00:36:53.258 --> 00:36:58.047
<v John Miller>that you could have access to. All right,
let's get into copilot now.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/610-3
00:36:58.047 --> 00:37:00.852
<v John Miller>So any questions on any of that material?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/612-0
00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:05.865
<v John Miller>And it's a bit dry,
but it's important that we understand</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/612-1
00:37:05.865 --> 00:37:06.732
<v John Miller>what it is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/613-0
00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:10.652
<v Majernik, Peter>How exactly do we enable those public
code filters?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/617-0
00:37:11.052 --> 00:37:13.841
<v John Miller>Well,
you'll have an admin console that you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/617-1
00:37:13.841 --> 00:37:17.444
<v John Miller>go in and do that there.
I actually have not done that myself</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/617-2
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:20.582
<v John Miller>because I don't have access to an
enterprise license,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/617-3
00:37:20.582 --> 00:37:22.732
<v John Miller>but I could help you figure that out.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/618-0
00:37:24.212 --> 00:37:25.012
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/623-0
00:37:28.732 --> 00:37:32.374
<v John Miller>All right,
so let's talk about the Copilot UI in VS</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/623-1
00:37:32.374 --> 00:37:35.947
<v John Miller>Code and some key features.
So how to add context,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/623-2
00:37:35.947 --> 00:37:39.729
<v John Miller>how to reference extensions,
how to execute commands.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/623-3
00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:43.652
<v John Miller>So let's take a look at those first.
Let me bring up a.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/624-0
00:37:45.172 --> 00:37:47.252
<v John Miller>Instance of copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/628-0
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:58.332
<v John Miller>So I have a simple project empty repo
pretty much.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/630-0
00:37:59.772 --> 00:38:05.012
<v John Miller>And so here's the here's the copilot
window. Is this can we see this OK?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/631-0
00:38:06.052 --> 00:38:07.412
<v John Miller>Is it too small?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/634-0
00:38:09.292 --> 00:38:10.252
<v Tarrants, Seth>Good for me.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/635-0
00:38:09.452 --> 00:38:10.212
Looks good.

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/632-0
00:38:09.492 --> 00:38:10.092
<v Carter, Jake>Is fun.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/637-0
00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:15.492
<v John Miller>All right, thanks. So up here is the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/642-0
00:38:17.852 --> 00:38:21.781
<v John Miller>Is to start a new chat.
So this part of the UI basically allows</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/642-1
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:25.097
<v John Miller>you to essentially clear the context and
start fresh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/642-2
00:38:25.097 --> 00:38:30.070
<v John Miller>This is something you tend to want to you
want to do when you're moving from one</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/642-3
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.692
<v John Miller>particular piece of focus to another,
so it isolates that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/643-0
00:38:34.092 --> 00:38:38.492
<v John Miller>And you can view the history to say what?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/649-0
00:38:40.132 --> 00:38:45.173
<v John Miller>What you can see here I had a issue with
the this GitHub repository and asked it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/649-1
00:38:45.173 --> 00:38:48.845
<v John Miller>to help me help me fix the SSH problems
that I was having.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/649-2
00:38:48.845 --> 00:38:53.637
<v John Miller>And then here's the new chat I just
started and you can see a list here that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/649-3
00:38:53.637 --> 00:38:58.803
<v John Miller>all of the chats that you've gone and you
can pick one and for this one it'll show</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/649-4
00:38:58.803 --> 00:38:59.052
<v John Miller>you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/653-0
00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:05.129
<v John Miller>What what it went through in the course
of helping me solve this issue.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/653-1
00:39:05.129 --> 00:39:10.362
<v John Miller>So this is good because now you have a
chat history that you can deal with.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/653-2
00:39:10.362 --> 00:39:15.939
<v John Miller>You here are some settings that you can
that you can set for integral aspects of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/653-3
00:39:15.939 --> 00:39:16.972
<v John Miller>things you can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/657-0
00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:24.522
<v John Miller>Generate agent instructions and chat
settings, and these chat settings are,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/657-1
00:39:24.522 --> 00:39:29.037
<v John Miller>you know,
things that you can do to control how</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/657-2
00:39:29.037 --> 00:39:32.612
<v John Miller>copilot works. You can the one that I.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/659-0
00:39:33.252 --> 00:39:36.612
<v John Miller>Typically what to try to do is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/661-0
00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:43.012
<v John Miller>Where was this? This changes quite often.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/664-0
00:39:54.532 --> 00:39:54.772
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/669-0
00:39:56.292 --> 00:39:59.152
<v John Miller>Yeah,
I'm not seeing what I was thinking of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/669-1
00:39:59.152 --> 00:40:01.947
<v John Miller>here,
but there's a there's a setting that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/669-2
00:40:01.947 --> 00:40:06.562
<v John Miller>talks about how to deal with the terminal
window that's useful to set.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/669-3
00:40:06.562 --> 00:40:10.072
<v John Miller>I think that's in the actual VS code
settings. I can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/669-4
00:40:10.072 --> 00:40:11.892
<v John Miller>I'll show you that in a bit.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/670-0
00:40:12.652 --> 00:40:12.772
<v John Miller>So.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/672-0
00:40:14.572 --> 00:40:17.712
<v John Miller>Undo the last request.
You can open the open the chat in the in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/672-1
00:40:17.712 --> 00:40:18.252
<v John Miller>the editor.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/678-0
00:40:19.932 --> 00:40:26.339
<v John Miller>Show a debug view of the of the chat and
or open the chat in a new window and then</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/678-1
00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:31.357
<v John Miller>up here there's an additional options for
for opening up a chat,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/678-2
00:40:31.357 --> 00:40:37.610
<v John Miller>opening up a quick chat and a quick chat
is nice in the sense that it just turns</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/678-3
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.772
<v John Miller>this into a another problem.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/682-0
00:40:39.932 --> 00:40:44.065
<v John Miller>We do in addition to this one that you
can also add context to and execute</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/682-1
00:40:44.065 --> 00:40:46.654
<v John Miller>prompts.
It's good when you're doing something</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/682-2
00:40:46.654 --> 00:40:49.134
<v John Miller>here,
but you have something that's slightly</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/682-3
00:40:49.134 --> 00:40:52.881
<v John Miller>unrelated and you don't want to interrupt
the context of this chat.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/682-4
00:40:52.881 --> 00:40:56.132
<v John Miller>You can create another one and do some
work in quick chat.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/685-0
00:40:56.492 --> 00:41:04.065
<v John Miller>As well as you configure code pollutions
and you can manage the the chat itself</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/685-1
00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:07.852
<v John Miller>and which actually takes you to copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/688-0
00:41:09.852 --> 00:41:16.683
<v John Miller>For for that repo and you can actually
have some do some settings here for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/688-1
00:41:16.683 --> 00:41:17.412
<v John Miller>copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/692-0
00:41:21.772 --> 00:41:25.653
<v John Miller>All right,
so down into the main chat window,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/692-1
00:41:25.653 --> 00:41:32.065
<v John Miller>the add context button allows you to add
different kinds of context and and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/692-2
00:41:32.065 --> 00:41:37.212
<v John Miller>context is important because it is really
what what copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/698-0
00:41:37.212 --> 00:41:45.133
<v John Miller>Has tokenized in terms of understanding
in your for about about your problem.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/698-1
00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:49.906
<v John Miller>So the context is a limited resource.
In fact,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/698-2
00:41:49.906 --> 00:41:56.812
<v John Miller>it's limited in two different ways.
It's limited in both what what.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/702-0
00:41:57.212 --> 00:42:02.264
<v John Miller>Can do with the information that you've
given it so far in this session,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/702-1
00:42:02.264 --> 00:42:07.801
<v John Miller>and it's also a limitation or something
that we have to keep track of down here</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/702-2
00:42:07.801 --> 00:42:11.469
<v John Miller>that says you know how you've actually
used copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/702-3
00:42:11.469 --> 00:42:16.452
<v John Miller>And you can see here that premium
requests I've used so far this month.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/706-0
00:42:16.892 --> 00:42:22.815
<v John Miller>Over 54% of the of my allotment in my in
my subscription for copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/706-1
00:42:22.815 --> 00:42:27.215
<v John Miller>Now I think enterprise those those limits
are very,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/706-2
00:42:27.215 --> 00:42:32.292
<v John Miller>very high and I actually since I upgraded
to the pro press.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/708-0
00:42:32.492 --> 00:42:35.443
<v John Miller>Version.
I've not actually exceeded this limit,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/708-1
00:42:35.443 --> 00:42:39.132
<v John Miller>but I did in the standard pro version and
you here you can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/710-0
00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:41.012
<v Majernik, Peter>What?
What is considered a premium request?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/714-0
00:42:42.412 --> 00:42:45.483
<v John Miller>All right, that's a good question.
Premium question.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/714-1
00:42:45.483 --> 00:42:50.233
<v John Miller>If you look at the models here over here,
this tells you whether the premium what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/714-2
00:42:50.233 --> 00:42:53.594
<v John Miller>what basically did.
These models don't count against your</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/714-3
00:42:53.594 --> 00:42:56.838
<v John Miller>premium request.
These are standard models that you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/714-4
00:42:56.838 --> 00:42:58.692
<v John Miller>take as much use of as you want.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/719-0
00:42:59.132 --> 00:43:03.116
<v John Miller>Right, so that's basically chat to GP4,
right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/719-1
00:43:03.116 --> 00:43:08.032
<v John Miller>Then you you have a model here that says
a cloud haiku 4.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/719-2
00:43:08.032 --> 00:43:12.693
<v John Miller>5 preview is 1/3 of a token and you have
those tokens.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/719-3
00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:18.372
<v John Miller>It was that bar I was showing you before,
so it's how many tokens.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/725-0
00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:23.412
<v John Miller>Premium tokens you have available to you
in that model.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/725-1
00:43:23.412 --> 00:43:27.957
<v John Miller>Then you can see here that there's a
series of cloud sonnets which are 1.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/725-2
00:43:27.957 --> 00:43:32.932
<v John Miller>X and then there's another one down here,
O2 mini, which is a third and a third.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/725-3
00:43:32.932 --> 00:43:37.723
<v John Miller>I've seen at times some when a new model
pops up, it'll be 10 times, so yeah,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/725-4
00:43:37.723 --> 00:43:38.092
<v John Miller>every.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/729-0
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:43.386
<v John Miller>Premium request is 10 tokens that goes
that goes against your allotment.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/729-1
00:43:43.386 --> 00:43:48.440
<v John Miller>So it's something to kind of keep be
aware of as you're changing models and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/729-2
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.427
<v John Miller>you use this to actually monitor how
those additional premium requests are</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/728-0
00:43:53.332 --> 00:43:53.412
<v Majernik, Peter>So.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/729-3
00:43:53.427 --> 00:43:54.292
<v John Miller>accumulating.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/735-0
00:43:54.812 --> 00:44:00.099
<v Majernik, Peter>So I have a practical question here.
So I was using the free version and I was</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/735-1
00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:05.119
<v Majernik, Peter>always picking the GPT41 and after a
while it told me that I ran out of my</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/733-0
00:44:03.652 --> 00:44:03.892
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/735-2
00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:08.532
<v Majernik, Peter>allowance.
How is that possible if they're all 0X?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/737-0
00:44:10.372 --> 00:44:14.452
<v John Miller>Maybe at that time they were the model
that you're using was a premium model.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/742-0
00:44:16.132 --> 00:44:22.577
<v John Miller>And and and it may be because there these
are 0X to me 'cause I have the I have the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/742-1
00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:27.104
<v John Miller>pro plus version,
not the pro version that that's probably</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/742-2
00:44:27.104 --> 00:44:29.252
<v John Miller>I think closer to the truth.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/744-0
00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:33.247
<v Harding, Mike>Yeah,
I think looking in Visual Studio Peter</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/741-0
00:44:30.772 --> 00:44:30.892
<v Carter, Jake>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/744-1
00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:35.332
<v Harding, Mike>right now it shows as a 1X.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/746-0
00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:37.612
<v John Miller>For these.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/748-0
00:44:37.652 --> 00:44:39.092
<v Majernik, Peter>Okay, thanks. Thanks.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/745-0
00:44:37.772 --> 00:44:37.972
<v Harding, Mike>5.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/750-0
00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:46.932
<v John Miller>OK, alright.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/752-0
00:44:47.012 --> 00:44:47.812
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/753-0
00:44:49.132 --> 00:44:51.532
<v John Miller>So we talked about any context. Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/757-0
00:44:53.692 --> 00:44:58.113
<v John Miller>We'll talk about modes in in just a
second,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/757-1
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:01.932
<v John Miller>and so then over here we have tooling.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/761-0
00:45:03.172 --> 00:45:08.757
<v John Miller>And so this brings up the list of tools
that are that are configured.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/761-1
00:45:08.757 --> 00:45:14.741
<v John Miller>There are a series of built-in tools
which allows you to do some very some</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/761-2
00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:18.092
<v John Miller>very basic things. One of the things that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/766-0
00:45:18.252 --> 00:45:23.188
<v John Miller>I think it's kind of nifty is that you
can if you're working in a web</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/766-1
00:45:23.188 --> 00:45:26.995
<v John Miller>application,
you can open your web application in the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/766-2
00:45:26.995 --> 00:45:32.354
<v John Miller>simple browser and that simple browser
then will allow you to add into your</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/766-3
00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:33.412
<v John Miller>context window.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/770-0
00:45:33.772 --> 00:45:39.786
<v John Miller>Some element out of your out of the Dom,
so you can actually move into the Dom</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/770-1
00:45:39.786 --> 00:45:44.886
<v John Miller>that particular element and then you can
get a add an instruction.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/770-2
00:45:44.886 --> 00:45:51.052
<v John Miller>Can you change this particular portion of
the web page in order to do something?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/775-0
00:45:51.252 --> 00:45:55.700
<v John Miller>Different to it, increase the margins,
change the behavior,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/775-1
00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:01.705
<v John Miller>just anything that you wanted to try to
do and it helps you focus the copilot on</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/775-2
00:46:01.705 --> 00:46:06.005
<v John Miller>a specific aspect.
So here we have a thing built-ins like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/775-3
00:46:06.005 --> 00:46:10.972
<v John Miller>getdiffs and change files.
You can edit files, you can add search.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/779-0
00:46:12.852 --> 00:46:21.433
<v John Miller>Extensions fetch code from actually from
a web page, manipulate a GitHub repo,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/779-1
00:46:21.433 --> 00:46:26.972
<v John Miller>scaffold new workspaces. You can use the,
say the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/782-0
00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:32.642
<v John Miller>Sure, I I have one problem down here.
If I if I I can go down now because I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/782-1
00:46:32.642 --> 00:46:36.372
<v John Miller>have that tool available to me,
I can go and say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/787-0
00:46:37.932 --> 00:46:41.373
<v John Miller>Problems.
You can see here as a tool and that would</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/787-1
00:46:41.373 --> 00:46:46.600
<v John Miller>that that makes the problems that are
reported here a part of my context and I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/787-2
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.629
<v John Miller>can now I can ask questions about like
and give instructions like you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/787-3
00:46:51.629 --> 00:46:56.062
<v John Miller>help me understand what this problem is,
help me fix this problem,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/787-4
00:46:56.062 --> 00:46:57.452
<v John Miller>that kind of a thing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/788-0
00:46:57.492 --> 00:46:57.572
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/793-0
00:47:00.332 --> 00:47:04.987
<v John Miller>So back to those tools.
So there's a whole bunch of of these</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/793-1
00:47:04.987 --> 00:47:11.169
<v John Miller>built in tools and then there here are
listen the tools that are that I've added</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/793-2
00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:16.740
<v John Miller>and there are tools for that are
specifically for dealing with Azure for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/793-3
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.732
<v John Miller>dealing with.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/798-0
00:47:18.172 --> 00:47:22.509
<v John Miller>Azure get Copilot for Azure.
Here you see I have pull requests enabled</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/798-1
00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:27.029
<v John Miller>so I can actually do pull requests from
the chat window and here are some</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/798-2
00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:31.916
<v John Miller>additional MCP servers and I'll talk a
little bit more about MCP and what it is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/798-3
00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:35.092
<v John Miller>and how it relates to these tools in a in
a second.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/801-0
00:47:35.612 --> 00:47:40.718
<v John Miller>If you expand one of these,
let's say the the pull request one,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/801-1
00:47:40.718 --> 00:47:45.346
<v John Miller>it it'll expose you know here exposing 3
different tools.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/801-2
00:47:45.346 --> 00:47:50.372
<v John Miller>The what the active pull request is the
co-pot encoding agent.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/806-0
00:47:51.852 --> 00:47:57.710
<v John Miller>And opening opening up actual pull
requests or all tools that are get then</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/806-1
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:03.802
<v John Miller>added and make it available to you.
So you could do something like instead of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/806-2
00:48:03.802 --> 00:48:06.692
<v John Miller>problems you could do something like.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/807-0
00:48:09.092 --> 00:48:09.492
<v John Miller>GitHub.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/810-0
00:48:12.012 --> 00:48:18.877
<v John Miller>And you can see here GitHub repo is what
I want and then you can say this is a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/810-1
00:48:18.877 --> 00:48:19.572
<v John Miller>command.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/812-0
00:48:21.372 --> 00:48:24.692
<v John Miller>Maybe I hit the wrong one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/818-0
00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:41.732
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/823-0
00:48:47.612 --> 00:48:52.601
<v John Miller>I should try something else. So anyway,
these commands we just do a blank list</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/823-1
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:57.400
<v John Miller>allows us to execute the different
commands that are available to us and if</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/823-2
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.852
<v John Miller>I go down in this list.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/824-0
00:49:00.252 --> 00:49:02.812
<v John Miller>We should see that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/826-0
00:49:04.492 --> 00:49:08.452
<v John Miller>There are here for VS code specifically.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/828-0
00:49:10.052 --> 00:49:11.132
<v John Miller>For for testing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/833-0
00:49:14.012 --> 00:49:19.012
<v John Miller>For MSSQL these are all,
these are all the extensions that I've</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/833-1
00:49:19.012 --> 00:49:23.544
<v John Miller>added and allow us allow me to do a very
specific things.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/833-2
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:29.873
<v John Miller>So for example with Mermaid I can ask it
to create a sequence diagram of a piece</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/833-3
00:49:29.873 --> 00:49:30.732
<v John Miller>of code or.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/836-0
00:49:32.092 --> 00:49:36.660
<v John Miller>And it will create it for me.
So the idea is I've I have tools here</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/836-1
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.900
<v John Miller>listed here and these are the these are
the the commands that those tools are</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/836-2
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.572
<v John Miller>providing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/841-0
00:49:43.852 --> 00:49:50.283
<v John Miller>This is allows you to start a voice chat.
So if you're accustomed to doing that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/841-1
00:49:50.283 --> 00:49:53.820
<v John Miller>kind of work,
it will allow you to do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/841-2
00:49:53.820 --> 00:50:00.332
<v John Miller>And then there is the actual submission
piece where you send the the the prompt.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/845-0
00:50:00.652 --> 00:50:05.514
<v John Miller>And to the Coco pilots,
you can send it with the code base tag,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/845-1
00:50:05.514 --> 00:50:09.312
<v John Miller>so it will actually include the entire
code base,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/845-2
00:50:09.312 --> 00:50:14.249
<v John Miller>or you can send it to a new chat and and
start a new chat there.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/845-3
00:50:14.249 --> 00:50:16.452
<v John Miller>So that's a pretty good look.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/849-0
00:50:17.132 --> 00:50:22.688
<v John Miller>Oh, here and here's another option.
So you can choose a a server to add and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/849-1
00:50:22.688 --> 00:50:28.536
<v John Miller>this will allow you to add additional
tools in in your into your environment so</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/849-2
00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:31.972
<v John Miller>that you can actually take advantage of
those.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/853-0
00:50:32.332 --> 00:50:38.316
<v John Miller>So let me jump back to the yeah,
so we the other thing I didn't show was</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/853-1
00:50:38.316 --> 00:50:42.332
<v John Miller>the at sign.
So this is where we're specifying a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/853-2
00:50:42.332 --> 00:50:48.972
<v John Miller>specific area that we want to focus on
and then we can say at GitHub the we are.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/855-0
00:50:48.972 --> 00:50:53.692
<v John Miller>Get answers are grounded in a web search
or code search or.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/857-0
00:50:56.132 --> 00:50:57.012
<v John Miller>At Copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/862-0
00:50:58.812 --> 00:51:04.183
<v John Miller>And what this is really doing is actually
telling it do you want to invoke the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/862-1
00:51:04.183 --> 00:51:09.009
<v John Miller>GitHub Copilot coding engine and you
could then ask questions that are</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/862-2
00:51:09.009 --> 00:51:14.652
<v John Miller>specifically targeted to that particular
domain and Copilot will figure these out.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/863-0
00:51:15.852 --> 00:51:19.218
<v John Miller>On its own,
but it's it's gonna be helpful to provide</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/863-1
00:51:19.218 --> 00:51:20.652
<v John Miller>them for automatically.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/869-0
00:51:23.132 --> 00:51:27.921
<v John Miller>All right, so let's go back.
We talked a bit about modes and models.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/869-1
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:32.501
<v John Miller>There's basically 3 built-in modes,
which is ask, edit and agent,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/869-2
00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:36.179
<v John Miller>and then you can actually create a custom
chat mode.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/869-3
00:51:36.179 --> 00:51:41.523
<v John Miller>So we'll go through all four of these
options during the course and describe</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/869-4
00:51:41.523 --> 00:51:42.772
<v John Miller>when they're used.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/873-0
00:51:42.812 --> 00:51:46.654
<v John Miller>And when they're available,
then you can do what are called</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/873-1
00:51:46.654 --> 00:51:51.072
<v John Miller>instruction files and prompts,
which actually allow you to capture a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/873-2
00:51:51.072 --> 00:51:55.427
<v John Miller>prompt that you have executed and
executed in a repeatable fashion.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/873-3
00:51:55.427 --> 00:51:58.052
<v John Miller>So if you have a prompt that you want to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/879-0
00:51:58.452 --> 00:52:01.504
<v John Miller>Execute over and over again at different
times.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/879-1
00:52:01.504 --> 00:52:06.781
<v John Miller>You can actually build a prompt file for
that and then it will be available to you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/879-2
00:52:06.781 --> 00:52:09.515
<v John Miller>to run.
You can also do the same thing for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/879-3
00:52:09.515 --> 00:52:14.411
<v John Miller>instructions and we'll spend quite a bit
of time tomorrow talking about what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/879-4
00:52:14.411 --> 00:52:17.972
<v John Miller>instructions are and how to use them and
how to create.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/881-0
00:52:18.172 --> 00:52:23.972
<v John Miller>Prompts and I talked about how to add
context and.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/885-0
00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:30.117
<v John Miller>So in terms of adding context that that
that was what we're talking about here is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/885-1
00:52:30.117 --> 00:52:34.688
<v John Miller>basically this is this is from context
you can add a a file or a folder and it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/885-2
00:52:34.688 --> 00:52:39.491
<v John Miller>will use that an image from the clipboard
of a particular instruction file and MTP</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/885-3
00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:40.012
<v John Miller>resource.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/890-0
00:52:41.052 --> 00:52:44.724
<v John Miller>A screenshot.
You can give it a screenshot of some text</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/890-1
00:52:44.724 --> 00:52:49.971
<v John Miller>and it will actually OCR the text and
figure out what's in it from something in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/890-2
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:54.889
<v John Miller>source control. I talked about problems,
symbols from inside of your code,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/890-3
00:52:54.889 --> 00:52:58.561
<v John Miller>other tools,
and then you have other things that these.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/890-4
00:52:58.561 --> 00:53:00.332
<v John Miller>This will basically listen.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/894-0
00:53:00.652 --> 00:53:06.152
<v John Miller>Recently opened files so you can actually
say I want to I want to work with the the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/894-1
00:53:06.152 --> 00:53:11.520
<v John Miller>readme file and it will then add that to
your contacts and you can then add it to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/894-2
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.532
<v John Miller>ask it to do something with your readme
file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/895-0
00:53:17.292 --> 00:53:17.932
<v John Miller>So it's.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/897-0
00:53:20.012 --> 00:53:22.852
<v John Miller>Go back to the slides. I lost my place.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/905-0
00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:43.996
<v John Miller>All right. So we've talked about that. So,
so instructions versus prompt files in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/905-1
00:53:43.996 --> 00:53:47.912
<v John Miller>chat mode. So this,
so let's talk just briefly what the what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/905-2
00:53:47.912 --> 00:53:51.186
<v John Miller>these are.
Instruction file is basically workspace</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/905-3
00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:54.332
<v John Miller>wide guidance.
So let's just say you're working.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/909-0
00:53:54.492 --> 00:54:01.265
<v John Miller>And you want to have a guidance on what
your your coding conventions look like.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/909-1
00:54:01.265 --> 00:54:06.852
<v John Miller>You can define that in an instruction
file and you can then then.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/914-0
00:54:09.052 --> 00:54:14.326
<v John Miller>Copilot will use that instruction file
for every prompt that you give it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/914-1
00:54:14.326 --> 00:54:19.743
<v John Miller>So you can do things like say this is
what my C# coding style looks like or</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/914-2
00:54:19.743 --> 00:54:23.307
<v John Miller>what my conventions are,
what your standards are,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/914-3
00:54:23.307 --> 00:54:28.652
<v John Miller>things that you would normally put in a
developer's guide of some sort or.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/919-0
00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:34.410
<v John Miller>Or a read me file you can put into these
instruction files and it will become</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/919-1
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:40.088
<v John Miller>essentially a part of your context and in
Copilot we use it for every prompt.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/919-2
00:54:40.088 --> 00:54:43.728
<v John Miller>As I said,
the format is either a Jason or a YAML</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/919-3
00:54:43.728 --> 00:54:47.222
<v John Miller>file.
There's a Copilot Jason file that you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/919-4
00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:48.532
<v John Miller>create or you can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/923-0
00:54:48.572 --> 00:54:54.468
<v John Miller>Create a YAML file or a markdown file.
I don't see a markdown listed here,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/923-1
00:54:54.468 --> 00:54:59.892
<v John Miller>but that's also included.
So you can find goals, conventions, tasks.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/923-2
00:54:59.892 --> 00:55:06.259
<v John Miller>The audience is the autocomplete engine
and it's located in the root or a dot VS</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/923-3
00:55:06.259 --> 00:55:06.652
<v John Miller>code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/929-0
00:55:06.892 --> 00:55:10.483
<v John Miller>Folder.
A prompt file is more of a file specific</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/929-1
00:55:10.483 --> 00:55:15.320
<v John Miller>or task specific nudging.
It basically allows you to say you want</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/929-2
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:21.256
<v John Miller>to accomplish something and provide it
with the detailed instructions on how you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/929-3
00:55:21.256 --> 00:55:26.532
<v John Miller>want to accomplish that particular task.
So let's say that you want to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/934-0
00:55:26.852 --> 00:55:31.129
<v John Miller>Generate a test.
You could have a profile that will focus</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/934-1
00:55:31.129 --> 00:55:36.291
<v John Miller>the copilot on that specific task and
perform that task in a persona,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/934-2
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:42.116
<v John Miller>which would tell it that you could sell
it a persona like I am a test engineer</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/934-3
00:55:42.116 --> 00:55:46.172
<v John Miller>that understands test development using
your tool set.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/938-0
00:55:46.492 --> 00:55:52.259
<v John Miller>And then it will and then you can outline
the steps that you want to take and how</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/938-1
00:55:52.259 --> 00:55:55.846
<v John Miller>you want to actually define that that
those tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/938-2
00:55:55.846 --> 00:55:59.645
<v John Miller>So it's localized context to improve code
completion.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/938-3
00:55:59.645 --> 00:56:05.412
<v John Miller>One thing I didn't mention about context
that I should is that we did talk about.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/943-0
00:56:05.732 --> 00:56:09.862
<v John Miller>That context is a finite resource in your
current session,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/943-1
00:56:09.862 --> 00:56:15.462
<v John Miller>so instruction files will increase your
context because it's actually providing</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/943-2
00:56:15.462 --> 00:56:20.292
<v John Miller>more context to your prompts.
A prompt file is a tool you can use to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/943-3
00:56:20.292 --> 00:56:25.612
<v John Miller>reduce the context and have it focus on
specific things that are important.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/948-0
00:56:25.612 --> 00:56:30.665
<v John Miller>And then you have custom chat modes,
which actually are interactive behavior</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/948-1
00:56:30.665 --> 00:56:34.143
<v John Miller>or tuning.
So you can create these custom chat modes</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/948-2
00:56:34.143 --> 00:56:39.328
<v John Miller>and they will show up in the chat window
and they can be focused on particular</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/948-3
00:56:39.328 --> 00:56:44.381
<v John Miller>tasks. So if you're writing C code,
you can have a chat mode that's targeted</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/948-4
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:44.972
<v John Miller>for just.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/952-0
00:56:45.252 --> 00:56:50.526
<v John Miller>Doing that. If you're reviewing C code,
you could have a chat mode that's focused</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/952-1
00:56:50.526 --> 00:56:53.355
<v John Miller>on doing that.
Or if you're writing a test,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/952-2
00:56:53.355 --> 00:56:57.214
<v John Miller>generating documentation,
all of those could be potentially</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/952-3
00:56:57.214 --> 00:57:01.652
<v John Miller>different chat modes and you can switch
back and forth between them.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/954-0
00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:06.171
<v John Miller>And it will change your context.
Any questions on this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/954-1
00:57:06.171 --> 00:57:09.012
<v John Miller>I'll show you examples of all of these.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/960-0
00:57:09.652 --> 00:57:13.222
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, sorry,
I I think you said something I didn't</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/960-1
00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:17.422
<v Carter, Jake>quite catch it about.
I think you said the instruction file</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/960-2
00:57:17.422 --> 00:57:22.532
<v Carter, Jake>increases the like the context.
So that increases like how much like the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/957-0
00:57:19.252 --> 00:57:20.612
<v John Miller>Context, yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/960-3
00:57:22.532 --> 00:57:27.292
<v Carter, Jake>context budget or it like it makes it
takes up some of the context.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/961-0
00:57:28.052 --> 00:57:32.092
<v John Miller>You know, OK, so in terms of the UI.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/967-0
00:57:34.052 --> 00:57:38.825
<v John Miller>Here it doesn't affect this because this
is these are requests, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/967-1
00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:43.800
<v John Miller>So what it's what what I'm when I'm
referring to context in that sense is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/964-0
00:57:39.652 --> 00:57:39.892
<v Carter, Jake>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/967-2
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.371
<v John Miller>what it does is that you have that
context window for your session,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/967-3
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:50.052
<v John Miller>which is how many tokens.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/971-0
00:57:50.412 --> 00:57:54.419
<v John Miller>You can actually submit as a part of that
request, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/971-1
00:57:54.419 --> 00:57:59.048
<v John Miller>So the idea here is that when you add an
instruction file in here,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/971-2
00:57:59.048 --> 00:58:04.230
<v John Miller>everything in that instruction file gets
added to your context and it gets</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/971-3
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:07.132
<v John Miller>tokenized and submitted as a part of that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/972-0
00:58:07.452 --> 00:58:09.252
<v John Miller>It's a part of that context, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/976-0
00:58:09.612 --> 00:58:12.405
<v Carter, Jake>OK,
it so were you you saying earlier that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/974-0
00:58:11.652 --> 00:58:12.052
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/976-1
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:16.692
<v Carter, Jake>like context is like a finite resource or
is that something else?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/980-0
00:58:16.972 --> 00:58:19.605
<v John Miller>No, it is. It's it's finite in two ways,
right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/980-1
00:58:19.605 --> 00:58:23.775
<v John Miller>It's finite in terms of the actual
working session that you have right now.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/980-2
00:58:23.775 --> 00:58:27.725
<v John Miller>And when you submit that prompt,
if that if the if the amount of tokens</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/980-3
00:58:27.725 --> 00:58:31.894
<v John Miller>that you're trying to put into that
context exceeds the size of the window,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/980-4
00:58:31.894 --> 00:58:32.772
<v John Miller>then the oldest.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/986-0
00:58:32.972 --> 00:58:38.265
<v John Miller>Context will be lost and it will no
longer remember those things and do those</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/981-0
00:58:34.612 --> 00:58:34.932
<v Carter, Jake>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/986-1
00:58:38.265 --> 00:58:41.455
<v John Miller>things.
You doubt when you get into a when you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/986-2
00:58:41.455 --> 00:58:45.526
<v John Miller>get into a situation where you're losing
context like that,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/986-3
00:58:45.526 --> 00:58:49.259
<v John Miller>then that's when hallucinations start and
when things,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/986-4
00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:52.652
<v John Miller>you know it just it doesn't understand
something.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/990-0
00:58:52.652 --> 00:58:55.618
<v John Miller>That you told it to do and it forgets to
do it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/990-1
00:58:55.618 --> 00:58:58.769
<v John Miller>All those kinds of bad side effects
happen, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/990-2
00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:03.280
<v John Miller>So that's context and that's it.
The other the other sense of context is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/990-3
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.852
<v John Miller>the tokenization in these premium
requests and how many of those requests</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/990-4
00:59:07.852 --> 00:59:08.532
<v John Miller>you can do.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-0
00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:11.274
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah,
so like in like I I guess I'm talking</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-1
00:59:11.274 --> 00:59:15.439
<v Carter, Jake>about more like the first thing you're
saying like it can only sort of like hold</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-2
00:59:15.439 --> 00:59:19.397
<v Carter, Jake>a certain amount of memory, right?
And whenever you give it and give it like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/993-0
00:59:16.772 --> 00:59:17.172
<v John Miller>That's right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-3
00:59:19.397 --> 00:59:23.511
<v Carter, Jake>these instructions in the the dot VS code
directory that will that'll just like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-4
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:27.778
<v Carter, Jake>make sure it doesn't forget those things
or will that actually increase the amount</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/996-5
00:59:27.778 --> 00:59:28.292
<v Carter, Jake>of things?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/998-0
00:59:28.612 --> 00:59:32.012
<v Carter, Jake>Things that it can like,
think about at once in like a broad sense.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1004-0
00:59:30.812 --> 00:59:33.477
<v John Miller>It yes,
it increases the amount of things that it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1004-1
00:59:33.477 --> 00:59:36.567
<v John Miller>can think about.
It's you know if you if you get it given</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/999-0
00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:35.972
<v Carter, Jake>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1004-2
00:59:36.567 --> 00:59:40.831
<v John Miller>an instruction that says that all of your
C# code must have a header that looks</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1004-3
00:59:40.831 --> 00:59:45.041
<v John Miller>like this at the top of the C# code,
then you're adding that as as if you it's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1004-4
00:59:45.041 --> 00:59:47.972
<v John Miller>adding it as if you had typed it into the
chat window.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1003-0
00:59:49.732 --> 00:59:50.532
<v Carter, Jake>So I I guess.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1010-0
00:59:52.012 --> 00:59:55.854
<v Carter, Jake>So if you like had like a like a enormous
amount of like instructions though,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1010-1
00:59:55.854 --> 00:59:59.794
<v Carter, Jake>would that like decrease the amount of
like context that you could give it at a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1010-2
00:59:59.794 --> 01:00:03.734
<v Carter, Jake>time like in the chat window like because
it has to remember all of these other</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1010-3
01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:07.132
<v Carter, Jake>things or I don't know if that that is
even a coherent question but.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1008-0
01:00:03.932 --> 01:00:05.652
<v John Miller>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1014-0
01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:10.997
<v John Miller>No, that's a that's a good question.
But what you're really doing is saying</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1014-1
01:00:10.997 --> 01:00:15.587
<v John Miller>it's a like a shortcut for saying I don't.
So I don't have to type this every single</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1014-2
01:00:15.587 --> 01:00:19.098
<v John Miller>time into the chat window.
I put it into an instruction file and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1014-3
01:00:19.098 --> 01:00:21.852
<v John Miller>have it apply and it applies then to
every prompt.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1015-0
01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:24.292
<v Carter, Jake>OK, I think that makes sense.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1016-0
01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:27.412
<v John Miller>Other questions?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1023-0
01:00:28.332 --> 01:00:34.645
<v Zhang, Yan>Yeah, I have a question.
So at work we are using Visual Studio</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1018-0
01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:30.612
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1023-1
01:00:34.645 --> 01:00:39.154
<v Zhang, Yan>like 2022 as our development ID
environment.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1023-2
01:00:39.154 --> 01:00:46.169
<v Zhang, Yan>So how much this modes and the commands
can be used in Visual Studio,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1023-3
01:00:46.169 --> 01:00:47.772
<v Zhang, Yan>not just in the?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1024-0
01:00:47.932 --> 01:00:50.612
<v Zhang, Yan>It's cold. Yes, yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1028-0
01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:55.690
<v John Miller>A good amount of it that they try to keep
the the the the two implementations in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1028-1
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:59.047
<v John Miller>parity,
but there are a lot of subtle differences</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1028-2
01:00:59.047 --> 01:01:02.672
<v John Miller>between the two.
You can do a lot of the same things,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1028-3
01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:07.372
<v John Miller>but then maybe and some of them are maybe
in slightly different ways.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1033-0
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:10.780
<v John Miller>I spend most of my time in VS Code.
I've done.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1033-1
01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.638
<v John Miller>I have used Visual Studio at times to to
to to generate some code,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1033-2
01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:21.366
<v John Miller>but so I'm not as familiar with the UI.
And the other thing about these UIS is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1033-3
01:01:21.366 --> 01:01:25.572
<v John Miller>that they change very regularly.
Things will move around.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-0
01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:28.912
<v John Miller>You know,
there used to be a button down here for a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-1
01:01:28.912 --> 01:01:33.151
<v John Miller>little while that allows you to delegate
a task to a to a background agent.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-2
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:36.275
<v John Miller>It would run.
It would basically create a pull request.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-3
01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:39.398
<v John Miller>It would do a whole bunch of work
unprompted, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-4
01:01:39.398 --> 01:01:43.469
<v John Miller>based on what you asked it to do,
and then it will then finish this work</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1038-5
01:01:43.469 --> 01:01:45.812
<v John Miller>and allow you to review that and create a.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-0
01:01:45.932 --> 01:01:48.838
<v John Miller>That pull request and actually
incorporate the code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-1
01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.896
<v John Miller>I was never able to get it to work.
I was always getting a authentication</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-2
01:01:52.896 --> 01:01:55.309
<v John Miller>error and then one day it just
disappeared.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-3
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:59.092
<v John Miller>So I'd expect to see it to go.
I would expect to see it show back up</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-4
01:01:59.092 --> 01:02:01.779
<v John Miller>again,
but I think the people have problems with</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1042-5
01:02:01.779 --> 01:02:02.492
<v John Miller>it that they.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1046-0
01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:07.541
<v John Miller>Decided to to pull back. So yeah,
it's something to sure. Yeah, so it's,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1044-0
01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:07.572
<v Zhang, Yan>OK. Thanks, Jack.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1046-1
01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:10.681
<v John Miller>you know,
don't be afraid if they move your cheese.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1046-2
01:02:10.681 --> 01:02:12.372
<v John Miller>They're gonna do that a lot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1053-0
01:02:13.292 --> 01:02:18.684
<v Majernik, Peter>Can can I jump in here for a second?
I I have used Visual Studio a lot and I I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1047-0
01:02:13.732 --> 01:02:14.852
<v Zhang, Yan>Yeah. OK. Thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1049-0
01:02:16.172 --> 01:02:16.532
<v John Miller>Of course.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1053-1
01:02:18.684 --> 01:02:23.598
<v Majernik, Peter>also used Visual Studio and VS Code in
parallel looking at the same Git</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1053-2
01:02:23.598 --> 01:02:26.942
<v Majernik, Peter>workspace.
It's not an issue like you can use VS</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1053-3
01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:32.334
<v Majernik, Peter>Code for all the magic generated stuff
and then you can pull up the project in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1053-4
01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:32.812
<v Majernik, Peter>Visual.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1058-0
01:02:32.812 --> 01:02:37.211
<v Majernik, Peter>Visual Studio, it's fine.
So you can basically have them side by</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1058-1
01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:40.460
<v Majernik, Peter>side,
use some some actions in one and then the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1058-2
01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:45.468
<v Majernik, Peter>others in the other and there is no
issues usually. Does that make sense?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1058-3
01:02:45.468 --> 01:02:49.732
<v Majernik, Peter>So basically both of them are enabled for
git tooling and you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1060-0
01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.952
<v Majernik, Peter>Kind of toggle based on what you're
trying to do,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1060-1
01:02:52.952 --> 01:02:56.092
<v Majernik, Peter>you switch to this tool or that tool and
that's it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1065-0
01:02:57.292 --> 01:03:01.149
<v John Miller>Right. Maybe,
maybe a little bit later I can bring up</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1065-1
01:03:01.149 --> 01:03:07.006
<v John Miller>Visual Studio and we can kind of take a
look at the different UI's and do maybe a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1065-2
01:03:07.006 --> 01:03:11.292
<v John Miller>compare and contrast or we could just go
down and just say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1066-0
01:03:14.412 --> 01:03:16.492
<v John Miller>What are the differences?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1071-0
01:03:14.492 --> 01:03:17.625
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah,
all I'm trying to say is that even if you</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1071-1
01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:20.693
<v Majernik, Peter>don't have complete feature parity,
it's fine.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1071-2
01:03:20.693 --> 01:03:25.066
<v Majernik, Peter>You can use VS code for all the prompting
and the code generation,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1071-3
01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:30.353
<v Majernik, Peter>and then you can pull up the project in
Visual Studio and work with it just like</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1071-4
01:03:30.353 --> 01:03:31.332
<v Majernik, Peter>we normally do.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1072-0
01:03:31.652 --> 01:03:34.452
<v Majernik, Peter>So they are complementary in a way.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1077-0
01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:37.801
<v John Miller>Right, right. Yes, they are.
And because if you think about it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1077-1
01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:43.647
<v John Miller>what you're actually sharing between
those two different ID ES is the code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1077-2
01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:48.012
<v John Miller>that was generated and that code is
shared repo, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1075-0
01:03:46.292 --> 01:03:46.492
<v Majernik, Peter>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1079-0
01:03:49.332 --> 01:03:52.772
<v John Miller>So you're just basically using two
different ID the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1078-0
01:03:49.612 --> 01:03:49.892
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1086-0
01:03:51.852 --> 01:03:56.065
<v Majernik, Peter>I I have another question John, is it OK?
Do we have time?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1086-1
01:03:56.065 --> 01:04:00.064
<v Majernik, Peter>So about these instruction files like how
do you learn?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1081-0
01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:57.972
<v John Miller>Go ahead. Yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1086-2
01:04:00.064 --> 01:04:04.348
<v Majernik, Peter>Where do you learn this from?
Like do you just copy, paste,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1086-3
01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:09.204
<v Majernik, Peter>modify or is there like a pro level
reference on how to craft these</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1086-4
01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:11.132
<v Majernik, Peter>instruction files properly?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1088-0
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:15.972
<v Majernik, Peter>Or is that are you gonna teach us on day
three about this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1085-0
01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:12.892
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1092-0
01:04:15.012 --> 01:04:19.438
<v John Miller>Oh yeah, yeah. Actually,
we'll probably get into that tomorrow.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1092-1
01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:24.694
<v John Miller>I have some examples of of how to create
a prompt and instruction files for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1092-2
01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.567
<v John Miller>creating prompts.
I have instruction files for creating</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1092-3
01:04:28.567 --> 01:04:29.812
<v John Miller>instruction files.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1098-0
01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:33.723
<v John Miller>I have prompts for creating instruction
files,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1098-1
01:04:33.723 --> 01:04:39.086
<v John Miller>so all of these things work together and
and I think you'll start to see from</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1094-0
01:04:33.812 --> 01:04:35.252
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, great.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1098-2
01:04:39.086 --> 01:04:43.073
<v John Miller>looking at those,
you know how you can kind of build up a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1098-3
01:04:43.073 --> 01:04:48.229
<v John Miller>an environment that you work in that
where AI is very consistently applied</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1098-4
01:04:48.229 --> 01:04:50.292
<v John Miller>across all those environments.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1100-0
01:04:52.412 --> 01:04:55.704
<v Majernik, Peter>So,
so these instruction files in a way they</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1100-1
01:04:55.704 --> 01:04:57.972
<v Majernik, Peter>have their own language, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1102-0
01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:00.892
<v John Miller>It's it's all marked down.
It's all English.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1105-0
01:05:02.572 --> 01:05:06.292
<v John Miller>There's nothing. There isn't.
There's nothing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1103-0
01:05:04.372 --> 01:05:04.492
<v Majernik, Peter>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1107-0
01:05:08.092 --> 01:05:09.692
<v John Miller>Tricky, tricky about them.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1109-0
01:05:10.932 --> 01:05:11.812
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thanks.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1112-0
01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:18.234
<v John Miller>All right,
so I just added asked it to to tell me</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1112-1
01:05:18.234 --> 01:05:23.129
<v John Miller>what the differences are so we can come
back in a bit and take a look at what it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1112-2
01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:23.492
<v John Miller>found.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1118-0
01:05:32.132 --> 01:05:37.171
<v John Miller>So installation and configuration.
So there's really just two things to be</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1118-1
01:05:37.171 --> 01:05:42.681
<v John Miller>aware of here is that you need to install
an extension in Visual Studio or Visual</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1118-2
01:05:42.681 --> 01:05:46.377
<v John Miller>Studio Code.
So if we were to go back to Visual Studio</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1118-3
01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:49.132
<v John Miller>Code, it would be through the extensions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1120-0
01:05:51.372 --> 01:05:52.492
<v John Miller>And if I was to look at.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1121-0
01:05:54.292 --> 01:05:55.252
<v John Miller>A copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1123-0
01:05:58.092 --> 01:05:58.292
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1124-0
01:05:59.932 --> 01:06:00.812
<v John Miller>So there's the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1127-0
01:06:05.932 --> 01:06:08.492
<v John Miller>Installed in in.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1128-0
01:06:10.212 --> 01:06:10.412
<v John Miller>This.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1130-0
01:06:12.492 --> 01:06:12.652
<v John Miller>2.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1134-0
01:06:13.852 --> 01:06:17.872
<v John Miller>So the GitHub code review assistant.
Here's the copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1134-1
01:06:17.872 --> 01:06:22.598
<v John Miller>This is your actual GitHub.
From GitHub this would install copilot</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1134-2
01:06:22.598 --> 01:06:28.452
<v John Miller>and the and the chat features of copilot.
These are these also update quite often.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1137-0
01:06:29.212 --> 01:06:33.705
<v John Miller>And you'll need to to restart the
extensions when they change,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1137-1
01:06:33.705 --> 01:06:38.412
<v John Miller>but that will get the copilot installed
and then you also need a.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1142-0
01:06:40.212 --> 01:06:45.500
<v John Miller>An account with with GitHub and I have a
here a couple of which one of those</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1142-1
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.826
<v John Miller>accounts has to have a GitHub
subscription associated with it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1142-2
01:06:49.826 --> 01:06:54.153
<v John Miller>either a free subscription or one of the
pay to subscriptions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1142-3
01:06:54.153 --> 01:06:59.372
<v John Miller>And when you install the enterprise
version you'll need to log into GitHub.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1144-0
01:06:59.932 --> 01:07:03.692
<v John Miller>Using that enterprise account.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1146-0
01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:09.782
<v John Miller>Any questions on getting it installed?
Anybody have any issues with it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1146-1
01:07:09.782 --> 01:07:10.372
<v John Miller>installing?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1151-0
01:07:13.892 --> 01:07:19.183
<v John Miller>You can share settings across the
organization in a dot copilot settings</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1151-1
01:07:19.183 --> 01:07:24.763
<v John Miller>that Jason file and that will be checked
in with your project and it will to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1151-2
01:07:24.763 --> 01:07:28.532
<v John Miller>control GitHub copilot through some
settings there.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-0
01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:35.949
<v John Miller>All right, so following along,
the idea is I'm gonna go through some</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-1
01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:39.780
<v John Miller>demos here with some prompts.
The first one I want to do is install a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-2
01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.244
<v John Miller>Golang for Windows,
which I've already done,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-3
01:07:42.244 --> 01:07:46.787
<v John Miller>but the idea is that you can use a prompt
something like this and it will actually</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-4
01:07:46.787 --> 01:07:49.359
<v John Miller>walk you through the steps of installing
that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1157-5
01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:51.932
<v John Miller>I understand that you guys may not be
able to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1161-0
01:07:52.052 --> 01:07:58.388
<v John Miller>Do this. I don't you'll have to,
but you can you can follow along and if</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1161-1
01:07:58.388 --> 01:08:02.901
<v John Miller>you can't actually install the Golang
installation,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1161-2
01:08:02.901 --> 01:08:09.150
<v John Miller>I'll be going through those same
exercises on my screen so you can just</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1161-3
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.452
<v John Miller>watch that way.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1165-0
01:08:11.612 --> 01:08:17.543
<v John Miller>But I I created some of the demos and
exercises in Golang because Go is a very</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1165-1
01:08:17.543 --> 01:08:23.924
<v John Miller>cross-platform, works on any any platform.
So no matter what OS you're using you can</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1165-2
01:08:23.924 --> 01:08:26.852
<v John Miller>get it to, you can get the code to run.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1169-0
01:08:34.452 --> 01:08:38.639
<v John Miller>And so you could,
I don't need to see extensions anymore.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1169-1
01:08:38.639 --> 01:08:42.248
<v John Miller>All right, so look at wow,
look quite a few here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1169-2
01:08:42.248 --> 01:08:43.692
<v John Miller>List of differences.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1171-0
01:08:46.492 --> 01:08:49.532
<v John Miller>VS code cross-platform. Well,
that's not what I wanted.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1173-0
01:08:52.092 --> 01:08:54.852
<v John Miller>So it looks like I need to fine tune this
prompt.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1187-0
01:09:24.252 --> 01:09:27.452
<v John Miller>All right, well,
so let it think about that for a while.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1188-0
01:09:28.492 --> 01:09:29.012
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1189-0
01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.172
<v Carter, Jake>I have a quick question.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1191-0
01:09:32.052 --> 01:09:32.772
<v John Miller>Right ahead.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1195-0
01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.784
<v Carter, Jake>Are we gonna be using Golang a lot for
this? Like this week?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1195-1
01:09:35.784 --> 01:09:40.299
<v Carter, Jake>Should we go ahead and download that
'cause we'll need to like get IT to help</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1195-2
01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:41.052
<v Carter, Jake>us with that?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1199-0
01:09:43.532 --> 01:09:46.736
<v John Miller>That could be helpful. I mean,
but you know, we can,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1199-1
01:09:46.736 --> 01:09:50.787
<v John Miller>we can use whatever language that you
guys have installed. I mean,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1199-2
01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:55.442
<v John Miller>there's no the reason I was picking
Golang because I wasn't really sure what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1199-3
01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:59.372
<v John Miller>platform you guys were operating on,
what operating systems, so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1203-0
01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:02.928
<v John Miller>It was something that was easy to get up
and running,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1203-1
01:10:02.928 --> 01:10:05.892
<v John Miller>but we could we could just as easily use
C#.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1201-0
01:10:04.012 --> 01:10:04.212
<v Carter, Jake>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1206-0
01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:14.728
<v John Miller>Yeah,
the focus is not on the syntax so much as</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1206-1
01:10:14.728 --> 01:10:18.972
<v John Miller>it is the higher level concepts and
getting us implemented.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1207-0
01:10:20.452 --> 01:10:21.812
<v John Miller>All right, so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1213-0
01:10:25.572 --> 01:10:31.370
<v John Miller>So I I I have created a a repo I sent you.
I saw an e-mail about that which is just</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1213-1
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:35.098
<v John Miller>strictly for the kind of the code
generation process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1213-2
01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:40.827
<v John Miller>I wanted to have a kind of a clean slate
that is this AI assisted development 1025</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1213-3
01:10:40.827 --> 01:10:41.172
<v John Miller>repo.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1217-0
01:10:42.092 --> 01:10:49.175
<v John Miller>And I had intended on trying to do some
mob programming with that a little bit</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1217-1
01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:52.582
<v John Miller>later.
We may have to curtail our our</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1217-2
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:59.755
<v John Miller>expectations on that until we can see if
we can get the mob dot SH installation</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1217-3
01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:00.652
<v John Miller>installed.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1222-0
01:11:01.852 --> 01:11:05.544
<v John Miller>But we'll be able to take advantage of it
anyway,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1222-1
01:11:05.544 --> 01:11:11.376
<v John Miller>and you can see that this repo right
right now I I used Copilot quite a bit to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1222-2
01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:17.209
<v John Miller>to do some things like rotation and I'll
get into the mob programming piece in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1222-3
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:18.612
<v John Miller>just a minute, but.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1225-0
01:11:19.052 --> 01:11:22.070
<v John Miller>It may turn out that I'll be the I'll be
the driver,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1225-1
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:26.797
<v John Miller>you guys will be the navigators and I'll
just type in all the all the commands and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1225-2
01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:29.132
<v John Miller>we'll use one machine to do all the work.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1226-0
01:11:32.172 --> 01:11:33.892
<v John Miller>All right, let's move on.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1231-0
01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:40.235
<v John Miller>So I talked about different modes.
So the first mode I want to demonstrate</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1231-1
01:11:40.235 --> 01:11:44.058
<v John Miller>is the ask mode.
Basically a simple prompt completion and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1231-2
01:11:44.058 --> 01:11:47.420
<v John Miller>inline suggestions.
So this won't change anything,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1231-3
01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.452
<v John Miller>it will only provide you with outputs
useful.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1235-0
01:11:50.652 --> 01:11:56.809
<v John Miller>It's useful in that for one is that it
just gives you the the output that you're</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1235-1
01:11:56.809 --> 01:12:03.119
<v John Miller>looking for. It doesn't change any code.
The second thing is that you can use some</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1235-2
01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:08.212
<v John Miller>of the more advanced models in ask mode
and not incur any premium.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1239-0
01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:13.588
<v John Miller>Token penalties.
Edit mode will what it will do it will</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1239-1
01:12:13.588 --> 01:12:17.682
<v John Miller>actually modify the code in the file
itself.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1239-2
01:12:17.682 --> 01:12:24.052
<v John Miller>So if you ask it to make a change it will
it will insert that change.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1244-0
01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:30.220
<v John Miller>The the next mode is agent mode.
It's more it can do more than just edit</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1244-1
01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.502
<v John Miller>mode in terms of making a modification to
a a file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1244-2
01:12:33.502 --> 01:12:37.226
<v John Miller>It can change multiple files and actually
perform actions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1244-3
01:12:37.226 --> 01:12:42.212
<v John Miller>So you can actually have it, you know,
create a poll request, you can have it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1248-0
01:12:42.412 --> 01:12:47.821
<v John Miller>Pull something from a git repository,
scan directories for files,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1248-1
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:53.559
<v John Miller>all kinds of things like that.
So agent mode is actually is typically</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1248-2
01:12:53.559 --> 01:12:59.132
<v John Miller>the most productive mode when you're
doing interactive development.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1253-0
01:13:01.372 --> 01:13:06.869
<v John Miller>But every agent mode request is things
against your premium request to content.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1253-1
01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:11.679
<v John Miller>Then there are custom modes.
These are to be able to execute specific</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1253-2
01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:17.313
<v John Miller>workflows and I'll talk about how do we
create some of those and Windows would be</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1253-3
01:13:17.313 --> 01:13:21.092
<v John Miller>useful. But the idea is, as I mentioned,
you can have.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1258-0
01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:27.836
<v John Miller>A custom mode that will target it to a
specific kind of workflow and this is a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1258-1
01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:33.537
<v John Miller>great way of reducing your context
because you can specify just the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1258-2
01:13:33.537 --> 01:13:39.574
<v John Miller>instruction files that you want to
include where normally they would be</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1258-3
01:13:39.574 --> 01:13:40.412
<v John Miller>available.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1260-0
01:13:40.972 --> 01:13:46.035
<v John Miller>Across the board you could say use these
instruction files in order to accomplish</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1260-1
01:13:46.035 --> 01:13:47.332
<v John Miller>this particular task.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1263-0
01:13:50.412 --> 01:13:55.016
<v John Miller>So let's we talked about the forking the
repos.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1263-1
01:13:55.016 --> 01:13:59.332
<v John Miller>So is anybody having issues with doing
this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1268-0
01:14:00.572 --> 01:14:06.124
<v John Miller>Basically there is, there's the AI,
AI assisted software development one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1268-1
01:14:06.124 --> 01:14:11.675
<v John Miller>This contains all of the basically all of
the prompts, instruction modes,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1268-2
01:14:11.675 --> 01:14:17.452
<v John Miller>the chat modes that are that I've built
up over my working with the copilot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1272-0
01:14:17.932 --> 01:14:22.454
<v John Miller>That you can you can apply to your own
projects very easily by just moving them</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1272-1
01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:26.693
<v John Miller>into your project or referencing them in
your repo. If you fork this repo,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1272-2
01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:30.989
<v John Miller>then you can create a personal copy in
your GitHub account and you can make</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1272-3
01:14:30.989 --> 01:14:35.172
<v John Miller>changes without having to worry about
doing a push request back into the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1276-0
01:14:35.452 --> 01:14:38.741
<v John Miller>Back into the source,
it gives you more control over what</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1276-1
01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:42.371
<v John Miller>changes that you make,
and if you come up with something really</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1276-2
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:46.737
<v John Miller>interesting that you want to share,
you can always do a pull request or push</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1276-3
01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:48.212
<v John Miller>back into the source repo.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1279-0
01:14:49.212 --> 01:14:53.361
<v John Miller>All right,
so you'll wanna have a copy of this repo</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1279-1
01:14:53.361 --> 01:14:58.068
<v John Miller>and as well as the the copy of the the
1025 version of it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1279-2
01:14:58.068 --> 01:15:03.892
<v John Miller>which is something that you will will be
taking advantage of it as well.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1281-0
01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:04.292
<v John Miller>As well.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1284-0
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.196
<v Majernik, Peter>John,
is the forking a suggestion or are we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1283-0
01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:11.652
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1284-1
01:15:13.196 --> 01:15:15.052
<v Majernik, Peter>gonna absolutely need this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1289-0
01:15:13.852 --> 01:15:16.605
<v John Miller>Well,
I think it's it's a good idea because I</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1289-1
01:15:16.605 --> 01:15:20.315
<v John Miller>think as you go through particularly some
of these exercises,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1289-2
01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:24.863
<v John Miller>it's going to make a change and you're
going to want to commit that change.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1289-3
01:15:24.863 --> 01:15:28.333
<v John Miller>If you fork the repo,
you have complete control over that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1289-4
01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:28.812
<v John Miller>process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1290-0
01:15:30.052 --> 01:15:31.572
<v John Miller>Whereas if you're.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1291-0
01:15:30.212 --> 01:15:31.772
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, got it. Thanks.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1293-0
01:15:32.692 --> 01:15:34.972
<v John Miller>Basically separates.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1292-0
01:15:32.812 --> 01:15:34.012
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, I understand.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1296-0
01:15:36.052 --> 01:15:39.412
<v John Miller>Separates these two different uses of
this repo.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1298-0
01:15:41.052 --> 01:15:42.532
<v Majernik, Peter>Alright, thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1299-0
01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:43.652
<v John Miller>Sure.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1300-0
01:15:45.452 --> 01:15:45.772
<v John Miller>Yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1302-0
01:15:47.692 --> 01:15:49.452
<v John Miller>Questions on that?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1306-0
01:15:52.812 --> 01:15:56.652
<v John Miller>All right. Let me know if you have any.
Yeah, go ahead.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1304-0
01:15:53.092 --> 01:15:53.132
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1308-0
01:15:56.252 --> 01:16:00.212
<v Majernik, Peter>Should should we be doing this right now
or later? Today is fine.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1310-0
01:16:00.172 --> 01:16:03.038
<v John Miller>Yeah,
you can do it during lunch or later today.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1310-1
01:16:03.038 --> 01:16:05.612
<v John Miller>That would be.
There's no issues with that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1311-0
01:16:06.132 --> 01:16:07.252
<v Majernik, Peter>OK. Thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1313-0
01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:12.092
<v John Miller>You just won't be able to follow through
following some of the examples.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1319-0
01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:18.050
<v John Miller>This was an idea I thought might be
interesting is that is to go out and find</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1319-1
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:22.279
<v John Miller>a repo in GitHub that is in a language
that you're familiar with,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1319-2
01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:27.085
<v John Miller>but process a project that you're not
familiar with and fork that repo and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1319-3
01:16:27.085 --> 01:16:32.339
<v John Miller>don't use anything that's in the company
because you don't want to use submit any</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1319-4
01:16:32.339 --> 01:16:32.852
<v John Miller>of your.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1323-0
01:16:33.092 --> 01:16:38.060
<v John Miller>IP right now because we're not using the
enterprise version and we can use this as</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1323-1
01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.489
<v John Miller>part of the legacy code portion.
It'll be useful in the sense that you'll</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1323-2
01:16:42.489 --> 01:16:47.278
<v John Miller>be able to say I don't know this code
base and I want to find out more about it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1323-3
01:16:47.278 --> 01:16:49.612
<v John Miller>and I want to understand how to use it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1327-0
01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:54.650
<v John Miller>And make changes to that.
And if you create a fork for it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1327-1
01:16:54.650 --> 01:17:00.379
<v John Miller>you can make all the make a bunch of
modifications to that repo and don't have</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1327-2
01:17:00.379 --> 01:17:05.092
<v John Miller>to worry about how to commit them.
So a prop like this would be.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1330-0
01:17:05.212 --> 01:17:08.906
<v John Miller>You know,
we would find something that that would</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1330-1
01:17:08.906 --> 01:17:14.372
<v John Miller>or copilot would suggest something that
would fit into the this criteria.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1331-0
01:17:15.812 --> 01:17:16.972
<v John Miller>So we could, um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1340-0
01:17:31.652 --> 01:17:36.277
<v John Miller>All right, so we'll see how that goes.
Now what I want,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1340-1
01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:42.389
<v John Miller>what I thought we'd try to do is just
just start doing some work in go in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1340-2
01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:46.932
<v John Miller>Copilot to implement a a a simple a
simple calculator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1342-0
01:17:47.572 --> 01:17:52.052
<v John Miller>So in our</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1347-0
01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:58.455
<v John Miller>1025 directory.
Let's use that as a as a place that we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1347-1
01:17:58.455 --> 01:18:04.933
<v John Miller>can actually write some code,
but I'd like to do this in a more of a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1347-2
01:18:04.933 --> 01:18:09.252
<v John Miller>mob programming style.
There's an add in for.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1352-0
01:18:10.772 --> 01:18:18.289
<v John Miller>Professor should we code which is called
mob and it will allow you to do a a mob</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1352-1
01:18:18.289 --> 01:18:23.578
<v John Miller>programming type process.
Anybody here familiar with mob</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1352-2
01:18:23.578 --> 01:18:24.692
<v John Miller>programming?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1351-0
01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:26.132
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1357-0
01:18:26.172 --> 01:18:31.039
<v John Miller>All right,
so the way the the idea is it's a it's a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1353-0
01:18:27.492 --> 01:18:27.652
<v Harding, Mike>Nope.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1357-1
01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:38.808
<v John Miller>collaborative effort and what so that to
where in fact there's a read me file here</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1357-2
01:18:38.808 --> 01:18:40.212
<v John Miller>that discusses.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1361-0
01:18:41.212 --> 01:18:45.290
<v John Miller>What it is.
And so the idea is that everybody works</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1361-1
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:49.838
<v John Miller>at the same time.
There's if you were all together in the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1361-2
01:18:49.838 --> 01:18:53.602
<v John Miller>same place,
you would have one computer and one</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1361-3
01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:59.092
<v John Miller>person would be doing the typing and then
you rotate the entire team.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1366-0
01:18:59.452 --> 01:19:03.873
<v John Miller>Through very short coding sessions where
each person gets a chance to do the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1366-1
01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:08.179
<v John Miller>typing and at that point they're not
really thinking about the work that's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1366-2
01:19:08.179 --> 01:19:11.623
<v John Miller>being accomplished.
The rest of the team is guiding them in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1366-3
01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:15.412
<v John Miller>terms of what they need to do.
It's a great way to collaborate on</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1366-4
01:19:15.412 --> 01:19:18.972
<v John Miller>something and focus on a particular task
and try to get that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1371-0
01:19:18.972 --> 01:19:24.685
<v John Miller>Done and it can go a long way to reducing
the effort that you need to put into code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1371-1
01:19:24.685 --> 01:19:30.330
<v John Miller>reviews because you've already reviewed
the code cuz you did it when you wrote it,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1371-2
01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:33.391
<v John Miller>right?
So I think it would be useful in this</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1371-3
01:19:33.391 --> 01:19:38.152
<v John Miller>situation since we're trying to
experiment with how to use copilot is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1371-4
01:19:38.152 --> 01:19:38.492
<v John Miller>that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1375-0
01:19:38.772 --> 01:19:42.625
<v John Miller>You basically as a team can drive the
process.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1375-1
01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:47.216
<v John Miller>I'll enter the information and do the the
code commits.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1375-2
01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:53.692
<v John Miller>That'll be easier since we're not going
to be sharing driver responsibilities.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1377-0
01:19:54.652 --> 01:20:00.372
<v John Miller>So that's how I thought this would be an
interesting exercise, so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1380-0
01:20:02.492 --> 01:20:10.372
<v John Miller>Let's start with a new chat session and
I'll do the first prompt, which is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1381-0
01:20:12.452 --> 01:20:14.972
<v John Miller>Create a simple.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1383-0
01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:19.372
<v John Miller>Command line.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1386-0
01:20:20.892 --> 01:20:26.572
<v John Miller>Calculator in C#.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1388-0
01:20:30.652 --> 01:20:30.932
<v John Miller>All right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1393-0
01:20:33.932 --> 01:20:42.529
<v John Miller>So this is a very generic instruction.
We're not giving it any more context than</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1393-1
01:20:42.529 --> 01:20:49.215
<v John Miller>than this one prompt,
and we're specifying the chat GTV 5 mini</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1393-2
01:20:49.215 --> 01:20:49.852
<v John Miller>model.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1398-0
01:20:50.372 --> 01:20:55.768
<v John Miller>And we can see here that it's used two
references so far. Prompt instructions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1398-1
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:59.594
<v John Miller>Oh, I have a.
So there's in addition to the instruction</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1398-2
01:20:59.594 --> 01:21:05.127
<v John Miller>files, we'll talk about this more later,
but there's a personal instruction file</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1398-3
01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:09.772
<v John Miller>that you can create and it's pulled in
some instructions from that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1400-0
01:21:09.852 --> 01:21:18.132
<v John Miller>That and then it's pulled in open setting
for for code instructions.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1405-0
01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:25.078
<v John Miller>All right,
so it's it wants to edit a a calculated</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1405-1
01:21:25.078 --> 01:21:29.458
<v John Miller>CS project file.
It's gonna look like this and it's asking</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1405-2
01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:34.877
<v John Miller>us for a permission to to do that because
it it's a tool that installed,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1405-3
01:21:34.877 --> 01:21:37.252
<v John Miller>but every tool that you install.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1407-0
01:21:39.532 --> 01:21:43.772
<v John Miller>It will not execute those commands unless
you allow them and.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1412-0
01:21:45.132 --> 01:21:48.939
<v John Miller>And so you can say then if I want to
allow it for this session,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1412-1
01:21:48.939 --> 01:21:53.697
<v John Miller>so this just while we're working in this
particular chat mode or in this entire</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1412-2
01:21:53.697 --> 01:21:58.277
<v John Miller>workspace so that any code in this
workspace or you can say always allow for</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1412-3
01:21:58.277 --> 01:22:01.132
<v John Miller>it to create that to to to to create that
file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1413-0
01:22:02.052 --> 01:22:02.932
<v John Miller>And um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1415-0
01:22:07.692 --> 01:22:11.212
<v John Miller>If I go to settings here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1417-0
01:22:15.212 --> 01:22:17.212
<v John Miller>There is a section in here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1420-0
01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:24.116
<v John Miller>In your your setting files,
it's going to be down here towards the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1420-1
01:22:24.116 --> 01:22:24.612
<v John Miller>bottom.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1427-0
01:22:34.892 --> 01:22:38.192
<v John Miller>Right,
these are the auto approve settings and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1427-1
01:22:38.192 --> 01:22:44.020
<v John Miller>what this does is it allows you to define
exactly what what will be auto approved.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1427-2
01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:49.567
<v John Miller>Notice it's a regex expression and a
actually a series of them and this allows</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1427-3
01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:54.412
<v John Miller>you to be specifically tailored if you
want one to run this command.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1431-0
01:22:54.812 --> 01:22:59.561
<v John Miller>With these parameters and allow that to
be executed and then there's a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1431-1
01:22:59.561 --> 01:23:03.908
<v John Miller>corresponding deny pattern where you can
say the remove command,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1431-2
01:23:03.908 --> 01:23:07.788
<v John Miller>the domain command.
All of these are you denying the auto</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1431-3
01:23:07.788 --> 01:23:11.132
<v John Miller>approve feature so that it will actually
ask you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1433-0
01:23:11.212 --> 01:23:14.892
<v John Miller>To allow it to execute that particular
command.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1435-0
01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.812
<v John Miller>Any any questions on these settings?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1437-0
01:23:22.052 --> 01:23:25.612
<v John Miller>All right, let's go ahead and allow it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1442-0
01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:31.450
<v John Miller>And so this is what we see now.
Notice that we have an option here to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1442-1
01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:35.808
<v John Miller>keep the change that we've made,
so it's essentially caching all of the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1442-2
01:23:35.808 --> 01:23:38.532
<v John Miller>modifications.
Notice that as it goes along,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1442-3
01:23:38.532 --> 01:23:43.012
<v John Miller>it marks these files here as being
generated code that we need to review.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1445-0
01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:46.941
<v John Miller>Alright,
so we have a now it's it's created a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1445-1
01:23:46.941 --> 01:23:50.657
<v John Miller>readme file.
It's created a program dot CS file,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1445-2
01:23:50.657 --> 01:23:52.932
<v John Miller>a calculator dot CS proj file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1449-0
01:23:54.292 --> 01:23:59.633
<v John Miller>And if we look if we down here,
actually I'll have to show you the next</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1449-1
01:23:59.633 --> 01:24:04.232
<v John Miller>time you run a prompt.
But down here this changes to be a dot</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1449-2
01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:10.241
<v John Miller>indicating that that the prompt is being
processed and when it turns back into a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1449-3
01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:10.612
<v John Miller>send.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1453-0
01:24:11.092 --> 01:24:17.335
<v John Miller>Icon is when it's finished processing and
now you can do a keep and there's this</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1453-1
01:24:17.335 --> 01:24:21.959
<v John Miller>keep will keep everything that is done
for all three files.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1453-2
01:24:21.959 --> 01:24:26.892
<v John Miller>This keep will keep only the changes that
we made to this file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1458-0
01:24:27.092 --> 01:24:33.074
<v John Miller>Or it made to this file and then this
keep in the individual file itself will</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1458-1
01:24:33.074 --> 01:24:36.679
<v John Miller>keep just this one change.
And as we go along,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1458-2
01:24:36.679 --> 01:24:42.967
<v John Miller>this becomes a real nice way of reviewing
the modifications on an iterative basis</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1458-3
01:24:42.967 --> 01:24:46.572
<v John Miller>so that you can stay on top of what the
AI is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1462-0
01:24:46.652 --> 01:24:51.445
<v John Miller>Actually doing right?
So let's go ahead and keep that,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1462-1
01:24:51.445 --> 01:24:58.852
<v John Miller>keep all of these instructions and then I
will ask you guys, what should we do next?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1463-0
01:25:00.812 --> 01:25:03.492
<v John Miller>To implement this calculator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1466-0
01:25:10.492 --> 01:25:14.572
<v Majernik, Peter>Well, did you? Did you build it? Run it?
Does it work?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1468-0
01:25:15.132 --> 01:25:17.732
<v John Miller>Oh, OK, let's try that then. Let's say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1470-0
01:25:20.852 --> 01:25:21.612
<v John Miller>Builds.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1471-0
01:25:21.092 --> 01:25:25.452
<v Majernik, Peter>Is this a console based app or does it
have a UI?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1474-0
01:25:24.212 --> 01:25:28.092
<v John Miller>But I asked for a command line calculator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1475-0
01:25:28.812 --> 01:25:30.252
<v Majernik, Peter>Command line OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1477-0
01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:32.132
<v Carter, Jake>So it looks like it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1478-0
01:25:31.332 --> 01:25:32.332
<v John Miller>So let's say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1479-0
01:25:33.412 --> 01:25:34.492
<v John Miller>Go ahead.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1487-0
01:25:34.612 --> 01:25:38.665
<v Carter, Jake>I was just gonna say it looks like it was
trying to build it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1487-1
01:25:38.665 --> 01:25:44.025
<v Carter, Jake>If you Scroll down to the bottom of the
the chat window in cases like this are is</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1483-0
01:25:41.532 --> 01:25:43.292
<v John Miller>Oh, right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1487-2
01:25:44.025 --> 01:25:47.751
<v Carter, Jake>this like the very end of it or will it
sort of let you?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1487-3
01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:51.412
<v Carter, Jake>Is it just like paused here if we like
allow this look?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1485-0
01:25:50.372 --> 01:25:51.532
<v John Miller>Yeah, it's just.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1491-0
01:25:52.132 --> 01:25:55.276
<v John Miller>Yeah,
so we could actually go and say always</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1491-1
01:25:55.276 --> 01:25:59.327
<v John Miller>allow the command.
net build and then from now on it will</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1491-2
01:25:59.327 --> 01:26:04.706
<v John Miller>proceed to do the build automatically
whenever it decides it needs to do it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1491-3
01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:06.732
<v John Miller>So slowly overtime you train.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1495-0
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:12.466
<v John Miller>Compiled it into what you think is safe
and what you think is dangerous and or</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1495-1
01:26:12.466 --> 01:26:17.248
<v John Miller>you can upload that that settings file I
showed you and then it becomes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1495-2
01:26:17.248 --> 01:26:22.488
<v John Miller>You don't have to basically allow every
single command for every single tool to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1495-3
01:26:22.488 --> 01:26:23.012
<v John Miller>do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1498-0
01:26:24.892 --> 01:26:28.865
<v John Miller>So it's done a build and see and it says
the build has succeeded.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1498-1
01:26:28.865 --> 01:26:30.852
<v John Miller>Let me give us more space in the.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1497-0
01:26:30.092 --> 01:26:31.732
<v Majernik, Peter>Yep, let's run it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1501-0
01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:36.104
<v John Miller>All right,
so let's go ahead and allow it to run the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1501-1
01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:38.172
<v John Miller>project. Always allow.net run.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1514-0
01:26:50.452 --> 01:26:55.033
<v John Miller>There it goes, and it works. So this is,
this is like pure live coding, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1514-1
01:26:55.033 --> 01:26:59.324
<v John Miller>We're just telling the IAI what we want.
We're letting it write the code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1514-2
01:26:59.324 --> 01:27:04.137
<v John Miller>We're not being too picky about the code
that it's creating. We're just, you know,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1514-3
01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:08.196
<v John Miller>trying to continue to move on.
So what's the next thing that we would</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1514-4
01:27:08.196 --> 01:27:10.052
<v John Miller>like to try to do? Oh, actually.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1515-0
01:27:10.132 --> 01:27:13.479
<v John Miller>Actually running here,
so we could actually do something else.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1512-0
01:27:11.252 --> 01:27:11.532
<v Majernik, Peter>Well.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1516-0
01:27:12.932 --> 01:27:14.892
<v Majernik, Peter>I would like to verify.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1515-1
01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:13.692
<v John Miller>Hey.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1519-0
01:27:20.972 --> 01:27:23.412
<v John Miller>Right. Or how about?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1525-0
01:27:36.732 --> 01:27:40.132
<v John Miller>Anything else we wanna do while we're
running the app?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1532-0
01:27:42.772 --> 01:27:47.907
<v Carter, Jake>Maybe test like the parentheses and stuff,
just I don't know, give it like it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1532-1
01:27:47.907 --> 01:27:52.067
<v Carter, Jake>So I'm reading the read me and it says it
supports parentheses.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1529-0
01:27:47.932 --> 01:27:49.292
<v John Miller>Do what?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1532-2
01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:57.072
<v Carter, Jake>So maybe like do something sort of
complicated with parentheses like give it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1532-3
01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:58.372
<v Carter, Jake>some sort of nested.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1535-0
01:28:05.932 --> 01:28:09.732
<v Majernik, Peter>Can we throw in a decimal number and a
negative number?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1536-0
01:28:11.332 --> 01:28:11.852
<v Majernik, Peter>Divide by zero.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1538-0
01:28:12.532 --> 01:28:16.012
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Yeah, I want to test that. Divide by zero,
please.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1539-0
01:28:17.172 --> 01:28:19.212
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Let's throw something at it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1542-0
01:28:26.052 --> 01:28:28.972
<v Majernik, Peter>We can try it without the divide by zero.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1545-0
01:28:36.052 --> 01:28:38.092
<v John Miller>All right. Are we satisfied with this?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1546-0
01:28:39.052 --> 01:28:39.572
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>No.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1548-0
01:28:40.692 --> 01:28:42.452
<v Carter, Jake>Yeah, that seems pretty good.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1549-0
01:28:42.212 --> 01:28:44.852
<v Majernik, Peter>It's it's good enough for a demo.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1551-0
01:28:44.932 --> 01:28:47.212
<v John Miller>Well, let's let's keep going though,
I mean.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1553-0
01:28:48.052 --> 01:28:50.692
<v Majernik, Peter>Well,
let's generate some unit test for it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1555-0
01:28:54.532 --> 01:28:57.052
<v John Miller>So what is it?
It's actually not finished yet.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1557-0
01:28:58.492 --> 01:29:01.572
<v John Miller>So now it's going to actually run the run
it for us.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1560-0
01:29:04.332 --> 01:29:09.772
<v John Miller>And we'll see. Well, I don't.
Let's see now here. This is where.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1563-0
01:29:11.452 --> 01:29:14.484
<v John Miller>This doesn't.
This wouldn't really provide a lot of</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1563-1
01:29:14.484 --> 01:29:19.091
<v John Miller>value to add this exact command line
because we're not likely to run this over</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1563-2
01:29:19.091 --> 01:29:21.132
<v John Miller>and over, but it does allow you to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1568-0
01:29:22.372 --> 01:29:26.302
<v John Miller>Configure that auto proof and this is
actually going to open up that settings</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1568-1
01:29:26.302 --> 01:29:30.232
<v John Miller>citation file that I showed you and it
tells you basically some some tests on</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1568-2
01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:32.952
<v John Miller>how to to do that.
But anything that you can create a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1568-3
01:29:32.952 --> 01:29:37.134
<v John Miller>regular expression for you could do that.
So you could create something that says.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1568-4
01:29:37.134 --> 01:29:39.452
<v John Miller>net run project and then anything after
that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1569-0
01:29:40.332 --> 01:29:43.732
<v John Miller>Is fine, so let's go ahead and allow that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1571-0
01:29:46.332 --> 01:29:46.372
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1574-0
01:29:56.932 --> 01:29:57.052
<v John Miller>So.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1579-0
01:30:05.732 --> 01:30:09.489
<v John Miller>So since we did that keep,
it's made a modification to the readme</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1579-1
01:30:09.489 --> 01:30:13.701
<v John Miller>file and here we can see what what
changed it actually made and it put in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1579-2
01:30:13.701 --> 01:30:16.092
<v John Miller>some examples into the readme file for us.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1582-0
01:30:20.052 --> 01:30:23.246
<v John Miller>Those look good.
So we'll accept those changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1582-1
01:30:23.246 --> 01:30:27.372
<v John Miller>So you I heard unit tests.
Is that something we ought to see?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1584-0
01:30:29.572 --> 01:30:31.692
<v John Miller>All right, so um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1586-0
01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:36.492
<v John Miller>There's actually a command for that to
say tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1588-0
01:30:40.092 --> 01:30:42.612
<v John Miller>So generate unit test for the selected
code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1590-0
01:30:43.732 --> 01:30:49.612
<v John Miller>And for that we could say I want the
scope to be the whole code base.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1593-0
01:30:55.492 --> 01:31:00.172
<v John Miller>So here it sees that it recognize that we
don't have any test framework set up.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1595-0
01:31:01.532 --> 01:31:03.732
<v John Miller>So let's go ahead and ask it to do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1597-0
01:31:08.812 --> 01:31:12.452
<v John Miller>Want to know which framework we want to
use? Do we have a reference?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1603-0
01:31:15.732 --> 01:31:19.882
<v Majernik, Peter>Well,
it should match the the framework of the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1603-1
01:31:19.882 --> 01:31:26.858
<v Majernik, Peter>code. I think it's big dotnet. Oh OK,
the tooling, yeah and and you need this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1601-0
01:31:21.092 --> 01:31:23.852
<v John Miller>Well, these are all. None of these are.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1603-2
01:31:26.858 --> 01:31:29.772
<v Majernik, Peter>I know Ms. test is better for us.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1605-0
01:31:30.412 --> 01:31:32.972
<v John Miller>Right, so we'll use Ms. test.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1606-0
01:31:34.492 --> 01:31:35.012
<v Majernik, Peter>Yes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1608-0
01:31:34.612 --> 01:31:39.092
<v John Miller>Notice here there's a command that says
in the workspace set up the tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1610-0
01:31:41.132 --> 01:31:43.372
<v John Miller>So it'll create a test roject for us.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1614-0
01:31:52.532 --> 01:31:57.088
<v John Miller>So at a test projects,
it wants to create a calculator test.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1614-1
01:31:57.088 --> 01:32:00.972
<v John Miller>So let's apply those changes that it
wants to make.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1624-0
01:32:14.452 --> 01:32:19.047
<v John Miller>It looks like it's done.
This here is going to do search for an</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1624-1
01:32:19.047 --> 01:32:22.780
<v John Miller>extension.
It didn't find any extensions that would</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1624-2
01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:25.652
<v John Miller>help us out. And did it change anything?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1626-0
01:32:28.252 --> 01:32:28.412
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1628-0
01:32:35.252 --> 01:32:36.852
<v John Miller>It doesn't look like it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1630-0
01:32:38.412 --> 01:32:41.292
<v John Miller>Created our like edits edits have already
been applied.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1632-0
01:32:44.852 --> 01:32:48.052
<v John Miller>So let's go ahead and now here's a.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1637-0
01:32:48.932 --> 01:32:54.038
<v John Miller>These commands to say insert into the
terminal. So you could actually say, Duck,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1637-1
01:32:54.038 --> 01:32:57.884
<v John Miller>I want to take this command and just add
it to the terminal.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1637-2
01:32:57.884 --> 01:33:02.233
<v John Miller>You can insert it into a at the cursor
position and the file itself,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1637-3
01:33:02.233 --> 01:33:04.692
<v John Miller>or you can copy it to the clipboard or.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1640-0
01:33:04.892 --> 01:33:08.232
<v John Miller>Insert it into a new file or apply it in
the editor.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1640-1
01:33:08.232 --> 01:33:13.273
<v John Miller>So we'll take a look at some of those.
Let's go ahead and run those commands it</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1640-2
01:33:13.273 --> 01:33:14.092
<v John Miller>wants to run.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1643-0
01:33:18.612 --> 01:33:23.287
<v John Miller>Wow, looks like it.
It thinks it applied these changes for a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1643-1
01:33:23.287 --> 01:33:26.812
<v John Miller>test project,
but it didn't actually do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1645-0
01:33:28.372 --> 01:33:30.572
<v John Miller>So let's go ahead and say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1648-0
01:33:37.932 --> 01:33:40.932
<v John Miller>Execute this setup test one to see if it
will do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1650-0
01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:47.132
<v John Miller>We went through this before.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1670-0
01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:28.612
<v John Miller>Any questions I can answer while we're
waiting for the tool installed?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1672-0
01:34:30.612 --> 01:34:32.452
<v Majernik, Peter>What is it doing right now?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1676-0
01:34:33.412 --> 01:34:38.502
<v John Miller>It's trying the the workplace calculator
project and adding calculator tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1676-1
01:34:38.502 --> 01:34:43.919
<v John Miller>I don't see that it's doing that though.
We seem to be caught in a little bit of a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1676-2
01:34:43.919 --> 01:34:44.572
<v John Miller>loop here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1678-0
01:34:47.692 --> 01:34:50.532
<v John Miller>O Let's change the prompt.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1679-0
01:34:51.412 --> 01:34:53.532
<v Majernik, Peter>I I think Seth has a question.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1681-0
01:34:55.252 --> 01:34:55.532
<v Tarrants, Seth>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1682-0
01:34:55.572 --> 01:34:59.777
<v John Miller>Yeah, it's the same question.
We've been answering like three times in</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1689-0
01:34:57.892 --> 01:35:00.346
<v Tarrants, Seth>Yeah, I think.
I think it's already done this,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1682-1
01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:00.132
<v John Miller>a row.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1689-1
01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:04.524
<v Tarrants, Seth>so it doesn't know what to do because
it's already been done whatever it did to</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1686-0
01:35:03.252 --> 01:35:04.732
<v John Miller>Right, right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1689-2
01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:08.335
<v Tarrants, Seth>implement it and it created a calculator
dot tests directory over there.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1687-0
01:35:08.212 --> 01:35:09.292
<v John Miller>Oh, there it is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1689-3
01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.372
<v Tarrants, Seth>So is there a separate CS project file?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1692-0
01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:18.532
<v John Miller>Right, so it did what it said it's doing,
right? So let's run the test then.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1690-0
01:35:12.852 --> 01:35:13.132
<v Tarrants, Seth>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1694-0
01:35:19.532 --> 01:35:19.652
<v John Miller>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1695-0
01:35:22.012 --> 01:35:22.492
<v John Miller>Thank.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1702-0
01:35:41.892 --> 01:35:43.972
<v John Miller>So you hear it's found the test project.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1707-0
01:35:46.372 --> 01:35:51.836
<v John Miller>It's read the project file.
It's found 6 results for test class or</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1707-1
01:35:51.836 --> 01:35:56.892
<v John Miller>test method and so then it's going to run.
net test commands.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1709-0
01:36:00.852 --> 01:36:02.492
<v John Miller>And it did good builds.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1711-0
01:36:03.652 --> 01:36:06.132
<v John Miller>And now it's going to run the test.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1713-0
01:36:11.572 --> 01:36:13.212
<v Majernik, Peter>OK, got some errors.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1714-0
01:36:14.172 --> 01:36:14.892
<v John Miller>Yeah, so let's.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1716-0
01:36:18.932 --> 01:36:20.612
<v John Miller>Take a look at these errors.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1717-0
01:36:21.372 --> 01:36:21.812
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1721-0
01:36:28.372 --> 01:36:33.212
<v John Miller>So what it wants to do here is what?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1723-0
01:36:35.652 --> 01:36:37.572
<v John Miller>We want to configure the project.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1725-0
01:36:39.212 --> 01:36:43.772
<v John Miller>To resolve these dependencies that it
that it that it needs.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1728-0
01:36:53.212 --> 01:36:55.372
<v John Miller>Let's go ahead and let it do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1731-0
01:36:57.732 --> 01:37:02.468
<v John Miller>And we can see here that it's made a
change and we've then added the test</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1731-1
01:37:02.468 --> 01:37:04.452
<v John Miller>adapter and the test framework.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1734-0
01:37:06.092 --> 01:37:11.372
<v John Miller>And it's upgraded the version of a.
net to to 8.0.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1735-0
01:37:13.412 --> 01:37:13.492
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1736-0
01:37:13.532 --> 01:37:14.692
<v Majernik, Peter>Sounds good.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1739-0
01:37:21.212 --> 01:37:23.292
<v John Miller>Uh, is that a problem now restoring?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1741-0
01:37:27.692 --> 01:37:29.092
<v John Miller>So it's thinking about that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1743-0
01:37:35.012 --> 01:37:36.452
<v John Miller>So it said it's.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1746-0
01:37:37.812 --> 01:37:43.572
<v John Miller>He wants to convert the test into a small
console test runner.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1748-0
01:37:44.972 --> 01:37:47.772
<v John Miller>So it doesn't need Nugent and run it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1749-0
01:37:50.092 --> 01:37:51.932
<v John Miller>How do we feel about that?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1751-0
01:37:53.372 --> 01:37:53.412
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1752-0
01:37:56.092 --> 01:37:57.892
<v Majernik, Peter>I I don't know.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1755-0
01:38:00.412 --> 01:38:02.452
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, let's set this item this one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1760-0
01:38:03.972 --> 01:38:07.310
<v John Miller>Well, no, no,
you guys are driving to go forward.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1757-0
01:38:04.332 --> 01:38:06.132
<v Tarrants, Seth>Let's go for it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1760-1
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:12.184
<v John Miller>The other thing we could do is we could
say no, I don't want to do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1764-0
01:38:12.172 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Majernik, Peter>Well,
when you say it's creating a console</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1760-2
01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:13.052
<v John Miller>I'll do this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1764-1
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:17.285
<v Majernik, Peter>project,
it kind of makes me think like it's</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1764-2
01:38:17.285 --> 01:38:19.958
<v Majernik, Peter>creating a custom tool just for this
testing,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1764-3
01:38:19.958 --> 01:38:24.490
<v Majernik, Peter>which doesn't really make sense to me.
You should be able to test it with the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1762-0
01:38:22.132 --> 01:38:22.452
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1764-4
01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:25.652
<v Majernik, Peter>built-in.net tester.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1768-0
01:38:26.572 --> 01:38:29.317
<v John Miller>Right,
so we could skip this step and not</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1768-1
01:38:29.317 --> 01:38:33.696
<v John Miller>actually change the project and and go
ahead and keep the changes,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1768-2
01:38:33.696 --> 01:38:38.532
<v John Miller>but then work on the restore process and
get the restore process to work.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1770-0
01:38:39.132 --> 01:38:42.438
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah,
so I would rather just fix the errors and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1770-1
01:38:42.438 --> 01:38:47.052
<v Majernik, Peter>resolve whatever dependency problems we
have. Something like that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1771-0
01:38:45.772 --> 01:38:49.332
<v John Miller>Alright, so let's let's skip that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1775-0
01:38:52.652 --> 01:39:00.655
<v John Miller>And let's stop it from doing what it's
doing and we can go through here and say,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1775-1
01:39:00.655 --> 01:39:02.532
<v John Miller>OK, we let changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1778-0
01:39:04.852 --> 01:39:09.199
<v John Miller>Changing some versions of the.
net SDK and I want to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1778-1
01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:11.212
<v John Miller>I thought I stopped that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1780-0
01:39:16.212 --> 01:39:19.372
<v John Miller>And this I I we keep this file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1782-0
01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:23.212
<v John Miller>We we like these changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1784-0
01:39:24.972 --> 01:39:27.430
<v Majernik, Peter>Well,
that seemed to make sense at the time,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1784-1
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.812
<v Majernik, Peter>I mean.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1786-0
01:39:28.332 --> 01:39:32.146
<v John Miller>Right, so we'll keep those,
but this is the minimal test runner that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1786-1
01:39:32.146 --> 01:39:33.252
<v John Miller>it wanted to create.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1788-0
01:39:34.372 --> 01:39:37.372
<v John Miller>And we don't like that, right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1789-0
01:39:38.452 --> 01:39:38.532
<v Majernik, Peter>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1791-0
01:39:42.732 --> 01:39:44.852
<v John Miller>Let's undo that change.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1794-0
01:39:46.332 --> 01:39:53.612
<v John Miller>And now that's gone away.
So what we can now do is say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1796-0
01:39:55.412 --> 01:39:57.732
<v John Miller>Um, run the build.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1811-0
01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:28.898
<v John Miller>Um,
so here it's asking us to make a proper</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1811-1
01:40:28.898 --> 01:40:31.332
<v John Miller>Ms. test project targeting.net 8.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1813-0
01:40:32.412 --> 01:40:34.292
<v John Miller>Yeah, but it's also asking us.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1815-0
01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:40.631
<v John Miller>I think what we want to do is we want to
actually execute this first one,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1815-1
01:40:40.631 --> 01:40:41.892
<v John Miller>but not the second one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1822-0
01:40:43.772 --> 01:40:46.905
<v Majernik, Peter>I mean targeting.
net 8 does does make sense.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1817-0
01:40:43.972 --> 01:40:45.012
<v John Miller>So it's giving it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1822-1
01:40:46.905 --> 01:40:51.128
<v Majernik, Peter>I thought that the original project was
also targeting.net 8,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1822-2
01:40:51.128 --> 01:40:53.172
<v Majernik, Peter>so the test should match that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1820-0
01:40:52.772 --> 01:40:53.012
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1825-0
01:40:54.252 --> 01:40:57.183
<v John Miller>So we're good.
So what I've done is I've copied the the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1825-1
01:40:57.183 --> 01:41:01.527
<v John Miller>option that's given us these two options
and we don't want to do the the test one,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1825-2
01:41:01.527 --> 01:41:04.614
<v John Miller>so the test runner.
So we'll give it that prompt and we'll</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1825-3
01:41:04.614 --> 01:41:06.132
<v John Miller>see what it can do with that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1829-0
01:41:15.812 --> 01:41:19.732
<v John Miller>So it's made some modifications to the
test project file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1830-0
01:41:21.372 --> 01:41:21.492
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1832-0
01:41:22.892 --> 01:41:24.212
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah, that's fine.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1833-0
01:41:25.492 --> 01:41:27.732
<v John Miller>All right, so we'll let it do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1838-0
01:41:32.612 --> 01:41:38.972
<v John Miller>Looks like it's increased the the test.
We'll keep that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1836-0
01:41:36.012 --> 01:41:37.332
<v Majernik, Peter>Yep, that's that's good.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1839-0
01:41:39.932 --> 01:41:41.812
<v Majernik, Peter>If it, yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1841-0
01:41:42.492 --> 01:41:45.572
<v John Miller>Then it wants to do a a.net restore.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1843-0
01:41:47.612 --> 01:41:50.212
<v John Miller>So we can say always allow net restore.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1845-0
01:41:52.212 --> 01:41:55.052
<v Majernik, Peter>Can somebody remind me what.
net restore does?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1847-0
01:42:00.092 --> 01:42:00.132
<v John Miller>Uh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1851-0
01:42:00.332 --> 01:42:03.770
<v Majernik, Peter>So John, just FYI,
we are working with the classic.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1851-1
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:08.794
<v Majernik, Peter>net framework versions like the old ones.
Everything you are doing here is.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1851-2
01:42:08.794 --> 01:42:11.372
<v Majernik, Peter>net Core like a different tool set and.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1850-0
01:42:11.812 --> 01:42:11.932
<v John Miller>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1853-0
01:42:13.132 --> 01:42:17.012
<v Majernik, Peter>I I can't remember all the connect
commands. It's been a while.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1858-0
01:42:17.932 --> 01:42:24.320
<v John Miller>Basically what it does is it goes through
your project files and it makes sure that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1858-1
01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.100
<v John Miller>you're it has the the versions that
you're specifying in your project file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1858-2
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:36.107
<v John Miller>So here the it's unable to resolve the
MSS adapter for greater than two dot 2.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1858-3
01:42:36.107 --> 01:42:37.172
<v John Miller>10 for net so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1860-0
01:42:37.452 --> 01:42:39.692
<v John Miller>It wants to be able to update that so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1864-0
01:42:42.932 --> 01:42:48.440
<v John Miller>It's updated the for project file be
proper.nettestfile.net aid,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1864-1
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:55.049
<v John Miller>but the restorer is failing because the
packet source mapping prevented Nuget</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1864-2
01:42:55.049 --> 01:42:57.252
<v John Miller>from using nugetop.org so.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1867-0
01:42:59.772 --> 01:43:07.113
<v John Miller>Two ways forward. Preferred keep Ms.
test and fix Nuget configuration and then</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1867-1
01:43:07.113 --> 01:43:08.972
<v John Miller>re-enable Nuget.org.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1870-0
01:43:13.852 --> 01:43:15.652
<v John Miller>So, so it's asking us up today.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1872-0
01:43:14.692 --> 01:43:18.901
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh, fixing the nuget,
fixing the nuget configuration.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1872-1
01:43:18.901 --> 01:43:20.772
<v Majernik, Peter>That sounds right to me.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1874-0
01:43:25.412 --> 01:43:28.932
<v John Miller>So re uh enable Nuget.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1878-0
01:43:31.692 --> 01:43:35.018
<v John Miller>But it wants in which one we want it want
to do.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1878-1
01:43:35.018 --> 01:43:40.515
<v John Miller>Do we want to go ahead and do it manually?
Cuz it's giving us things open Visual</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1878-2
01:43:40.515 --> 01:43:42.212
<v John Miller>Studio. It's interesting.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1879-0
01:43:43.532 --> 01:43:45.972
<v John Miller>So let's go ahead and edit the Nougat
config.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1881-0
01:43:47.412 --> 01:43:48.532
<v John Miller>And do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1883-0
01:43:51.532 --> 01:43:51.572
<v Majernik, Peter>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1886-0
01:43:56.572 --> 01:44:01.357
<v John Miller>So this is what one of the reasons I
wanted to try go is it doesn't have a lot</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1886-1
01:44:01.357 --> 01:44:02.932
<v John Miller>of these odd dependencies.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1888-0
01:44:06.812 --> 01:44:08.252
<v John Miller>But let's see how we do.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1889-0
01:44:08.812 --> 01:44:10.932
<v Majernik, Peter>It's mapping from.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1892-0
01:44:13.892 --> 01:44:17.132
<v John Miller>So here it's created a new file you get
config.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1902-0
01:44:37.412 --> 01:44:38.932
<v John Miller>Oh, it looks like it restore completed.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1903-0
01:44:40.492 --> 01:44:42.292
<v John Miller>And now we can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1905-0
01:44:43.572 --> 01:44:44.772
<v John Miller>Let's see.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1907-0
01:44:45.932 --> 01:44:48.932
<v John Miller>Always allow.net test which is good.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1910-0
01:44:56.772 --> 01:44:57.892
<v John Miller>Voila, a test pass.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1913-0
01:45:09.492 --> 01:45:11.372
<v John Miller>Well, let's take a look at our tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1916-0
01:45:18.212 --> 01:45:20.012
<v John Miller>It's the project.
Here's our unit test file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1919-0
01:45:24.532 --> 01:45:28.292
<v John Miller>Pretty simple one dot 1 + 1 is 2, 2 -,
1 is 1.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1921-0
01:45:28.332 --> 01:45:31.372
<v John Miller>2 -, 1 is one. You happy with that?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1922-0
01:45:34.812 --> 01:45:35.172
Oh yeah.

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1924-0
01:45:38.572 --> 01:45:41.892
<v John Miller>You want to add more tasks because we're
only testing addition and subtraction.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1928-0
01:45:42.932 --> 01:45:46.772
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Yeah.
So how can we start reporting on coverage</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1928-1
01:45:46.772 --> 01:45:51.412
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>out of, you know,
all the features of a calculator versus</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1928-2
01:45:51.412 --> 01:45:52.932
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>what we tested and?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1929-0
01:45:54.332 --> 01:45:54.732
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Sister.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1931-0
01:45:55.052 --> 01:45:59.172
<v John Miller>All right, which one do you want us to do?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1934-0
01:46:02.012 --> 01:46:05.479
<v John Miller>What do you want to do first?
Do you want to add more tests or report</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1934-1
01:46:05.479 --> 01:46:06.172
<v John Miller>code coverage?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1936-0
01:46:06.332 --> 01:46:10.308
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>For court court coverage,
I think adding more tests would be we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1936-1
01:46:10.308 --> 01:46:12.172
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>could see how it changes then.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1941-0
01:46:15.172 --> 01:46:20.733
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Maybe not so much code coverage here,
but it's uh feature coverage or something</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1941-1
01:46:20.733 --> 01:46:24.000
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>like that.
So if the calculator can perform 20</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1941-2
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.572
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>operations and we only tested 2 then.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1943-0
01:46:27.532 --> 01:46:30.584
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>That will be 10% coverage, uh,
test coverage,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1943-1
01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:32.972
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>I would say a feature test coverage.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1946-0
01:46:32.732 --> 01:46:36.944
<v John Miller>So I've given it the a prompt that says
report the code coverage when you run the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1946-1
01:46:36.944 --> 01:46:37.252
<v John Miller>tests.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1945-0
01:46:37.212 --> 01:46:37.932
<v Skrzeszewski, Tom>Mhm.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1950-0
01:46:38.772 --> 01:46:44.424
<v John Miller>And hopefully if that's that'll stay in
the context as long as we don't do a new</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1950-1
01:46:44.424 --> 01:46:48.052
<v John Miller>session here and it will run the the code
coverage.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1953-0
01:46:55.332 --> 01:47:00.922
<v John Miller>Now it needs to update the test project
file to add a dependency on the coverage</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1953-1
01:47:00.922 --> 01:47:01.612
<v John Miller>collector.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1963-0
01:47:23.092 --> 01:47:25.812
<v John Miller>It looks like it created a new file.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1970-0
01:47:44.012 --> 01:47:44.492
<v Majernik, Peter>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1977-0
01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:55.968
<v John Miller>All right,
so here it's reported the coverage files</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1977-1
01:47:55.968 --> 01:48:02.332
<v John Miller>analyzed is just the program dot CS file.
Valid lines are 48 line coverage is 0%.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1983-0
01:48:11.532 --> 01:48:16.444
<v Tarrants, Seth>So the tests were simply performing a
validation of the basic languages</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1983-1
01:48:16.444 --> 01:48:20.059
<v Tarrants, Seth>arithmetic.
It wasn't calling any of the actual code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1981-0
01:48:19.332 --> 01:48:19.492
<v John Miller>Right.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1983-2
01:48:20.059 --> 01:48:21.492
<v Tarrants, Seth>that was implemented.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1985-0
01:48:21.612 --> 01:48:25.860
<v John Miller>That's correct.
This is why we we need to review the code,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1985-1
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.292
<v John Miller>right?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1986-0
01:48:28.172 --> 01:48:30.292
<v John Miller>It's testing edition.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1990-0
01:48:32.812 --> 01:48:36.653
<v John Miller>So it's not calling it any of the code.
So what is it?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1990-1
01:48:36.653 --> 01:48:41.612
<v John Miller>So it's saying why unit test don't
reference any of the exercise code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1992-0
01:48:45.892 --> 01:48:48.399
<v John Miller>All right,
so add testable AI surface to the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1992-1
01:48:48.399 --> 01:48:49.012
<v John Miller>calculator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1995-0
01:48:51.052 --> 01:48:55.259
<v John Miller>And then we can go down here and say,
all right, let's do, well,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1995-1
01:48:55.259 --> 01:48:56.812
<v John Miller>let's keep what we have.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/1996-0
01:48:58.372 --> 01:48:58.452
<v John Miller>See.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2000-0
01:48:59.412 --> 01:49:07.459
<v John Miller>You you want to kind of keep hitting the
keep button often because you we have a</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2000-1
01:49:07.459 --> 01:49:14.612
<v John Miller>we have a repository that has the changes,
51 changes is kind of a lot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2006-0
01:49:14.812 --> 01:49:18.735
<v John Miller>To have in a commit session.
So why don't we push our changes into the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2006-1
01:49:18.735 --> 01:49:23.376
<v John Miller>repo so that we can see what modification,
see what modifications are accumulating.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2006-2
01:49:23.376 --> 01:49:27.851
<v John Miller>One of my favorite features is this one
here is to generate a commit message and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2006-3
01:49:27.851 --> 01:49:32.050
<v John Miller>if you have a template that you've
associated with the your commit message,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2006-4
01:49:32.050 --> 01:49:33.652
<v John Miller>it will follow that template.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2007-0
01:49:34.292 --> 01:49:34.372
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2008-0
01:49:35.612 --> 01:49:36.572
<v John Miller>And.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2009-0
01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:41.012
<v John Miller>So add the initial.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2011-0
01:49:39.612 --> 01:49:42.931
<v Majernik, Peter>Is that a?
Is that a copilot feature as well the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2011-1
01:49:42.931 --> 01:49:44.692
<v Majernik, Peter>generating of the message?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2016-0
01:49:43.052 --> 01:49:49.292
<v John Miller>Yes, yeah, yeah. And it uses Copilot.
It'll go and look at your code and then</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2016-1
01:49:49.292 --> 01:49:55.692
<v John Miller>it'll try to create a message that makes
some sense about what it actually did.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2016-2
01:49:55.692 --> 01:50:02.172
<v John Miller>So it created a runtime configuration,
added a new get dependency specification.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2018-0
01:50:02.572 --> 01:50:07.652
<v John Miller>And has build properties included
assemblies established the source link.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2020-0
01:50:10.132 --> 01:50:13.932
<v John Miller>Integrated the project accesses and
updated the project you get.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2023-0
01:50:20.652 --> 01:50:23.412
<v John Miller>All right, so what's not answered?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2025-0
01:50:24.492 --> 01:50:28.652
<v John Miller>I I don't see anything related to
calculator dot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2028-0
01:50:30.452 --> 01:50:35.702
<v John Miller>Yes, about the implementation itself.
So this is something you also kind of be</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2028-1
01:50:35.702 --> 01:50:38.892
<v John Miller>aware of and sometimes it will take a
shortcut.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2029-0
01:50:41.372 --> 01:50:42.412
<v John Miller>And um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2034-0
01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:49.275
<v John Miller>And give you a commit message that's very
generic and bland,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2034-1
01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:54.521
<v John Miller>like updated the documentation to make it
more clear and which isn't all that</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2034-2
01:50:54.521 --> 01:50:57.682
<v John Miller>helpful,
but it's it's useful to be able to at</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2034-3
01:50:57.682 --> 01:51:00.372
<v John Miller>least get a start on something that way.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2036-0
01:51:02.772 --> 01:51:05.892
<v John Miller>Wait, I need to.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2038-0
01:51:08.772 --> 01:51:10.452
<v John Miller>Stage those changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2040-0
01:51:11.972 --> 01:51:14.332
<v John Miller>And then I can do our commit.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2042-0
01:51:17.812 --> 01:51:20.412
<v John Miller>And let's go ahead and ush those U to the
repo.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2047-0
01:51:23.612 --> 01:51:27.839
<v John Miller>All right, so suggested next steps,
add testable API surface to the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2047-1
01:51:27.839 --> 01:51:31.879
<v John Miller>calculator and then it wants to add unit
test to the calculator,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2047-2
01:51:31.879 --> 01:51:36.851
<v John Miller>which is what we were talking about doing.
And then after the tests are called,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2047-3
01:51:36.851 --> 01:51:40.332
<v John Miller>it wants to rerun the coverage to see if
it's improved.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2048-0
01:51:40.692 --> 01:51:43.452
<v John Miller>So what we can do is say is um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2050-0
01:51:44.332 --> 01:51:46.532
<v John Miller>Go ahead and and submit.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2052-0
01:51:48.172 --> 01:51:50.292
<v John Miller>Number one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2054-0
01:51:55.052 --> 01:51:56.492
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's cool.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2057-0
01:52:01.172 --> 01:52:04.212
<v John Miller>So this will just do the first step.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2061-0
01:52:17.092 --> 01:52:17.172
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2064-0
01:52:27.372 --> 01:52:30.132
<v John Miller>So it's done everything that you need to
do for that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2071-0
01:52:46.572 --> 01:52:46.772
<v John Miller>Sorry.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2073-0
01:52:48.652 --> 01:52:52.314
<v Majernik, Peter>So when you submitted one,
wasn't it supposed to make some code</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2073-1
01:52:52.314 --> 01:52:52.772
<v Majernik, Peter>changes?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2075-0
01:52:52.972 --> 01:52:56.372
<v John Miller>Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Let me stop this.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2076-0
01:52:54.732 --> 01:52:57.212
<v Majernik, Peter>So when are the pending changes?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2079-0
01:52:59.692 --> 01:53:05.892
<v John Miller>Right. So maybe that prompt wasn't right.
Let's go back up here and say.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2080-0
01:53:08.572 --> 01:53:08.772
<v John Miller>Um.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2083-0
01:53:17.172 --> 01:53:19.812
<v John Miller>To add the testable surface.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2087-0
01:53:22.972 --> 01:53:26.013
<v Tarrants, Seth>So quick question,
I noticed that that prompt had an OR</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2087-1
01:53:26.013 --> 01:53:28.891
<v Tarrants, Seth>statement.
So how does it determine the logic behind</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2087-2
01:53:28.891 --> 01:53:31.172
<v Tarrants, Seth>that or is that a failed or flawed prompt?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2088-0
01:53:32.132 --> 01:53:33.532
<v John Miller>Which one here?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2090-0
01:53:33.892 --> 01:53:35.972
<v Tarrants, Seth>The I think it was #1.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2092-0
01:53:37.492 --> 01:53:39.532
<v John Miller>Up here.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2093-0
01:53:37.652 --> 01:53:39.452
<v Tarrants, Seth>When it was creating the evaluator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2097-0
01:53:41.532 --> 01:53:45.352
<v Tarrants, Seth>Or make the existing method public,
internal and testable.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2095-0
01:53:42.532 --> 01:53:42.572
<v John Miller>Oh.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2097-1
01:53:45.352 --> 01:53:47.812
<v Tarrants, Seth>Is that what we're calling to perform?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2100-0
01:53:49.092 --> 01:53:51.285
<v John Miller>Yeah,
we didn't specify which one that we</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2100-1
01:53:51.285 --> 01:53:54.157
<v John Miller>wanted it to do.
We just specified to add the testable</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2100-2
01:53:54.157 --> 01:53:55.932
<v John Miller>surface. So let's see what it did.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2099-0
01:53:54.852 --> 01:53:55.012
<v Tarrants, Seth>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2104-0
01:54:04.572 --> 01:54:07.892
<v John Miller>So it's saying it's adding a new public
evaluator class.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2107-0
01:54:14.532 --> 01:54:17.692
<v John Miller>And that's the it's.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2109-0
01:54:20.052 --> 01:54:21.692
<v John Miller>Right. So that's what I did it.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2111-0
01:54:24.412 --> 01:54:27.798
<v John Miller>So we had it.
So it it took the first option and and</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2111-1
01:54:27.798 --> 01:54:29.012
<v John Miller>not the second one.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2113-0
01:54:33.372 --> 01:54:35.572
<v John Miller>So where do we end up?</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2115-0
01:54:37.092 --> 01:54:39.892
<v John Miller>Added the testable calculator class.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2117-0
01:54:43.252 --> 01:54:46.652
<v John Miller>Updated the CLI to use the evaluator.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2120-0
01:54:47.612 --> 01:54:53.132
<v John Miller>Updated the unit test that called the
evaluator and then it ran test coverage.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2123-0
01:54:56.972 --> 01:55:04.372
<v John Miller>And it's now overall test coverage is 15
out of lines out of 4831% and.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2125-0
01:55:05.692 --> 01:55:09.332
<v John Miller>And 28% for the branch.
So let's take a look at what it changed.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2127-0
01:55:12.412 --> 01:55:16.052
<v John Miller>So in rogram dot CS it's done a lot.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2130-0
01:55:18.572 --> 01:55:22.772
<v John Miller>And one nice feature of this is that we
can, we can, like I said, we can.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2131-0
01:55:23.772 --> 01:55:26.332
<v John Miller>Accept those changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2133-0
01:55:27.292 --> 01:55:29.372
<v John Miller>Don't see it letting us do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2135-0
01:55:31.052 --> 01:55:34.478
<v John Miller>Um,
you can navigate through this through all</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2135-1
01:55:34.478 --> 01:55:35.372
<v John Miller>the changes.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2136-0
01:55:35.612 --> 01:55:35.772
<v John Miller>Just.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2140-0
01:55:37.092 --> 01:55:42.218
<v John Miller>And review them.
So here's the first one we can set.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2140-1
01:55:42.218 --> 01:55:43.572
<v John Miller>It's changing.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2143-0
01:55:44.532 --> 01:55:51.066
<v John Miller>Evaluate expression to the calculator
library evaluator and you will should see</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2143-1
01:55:51.066 --> 01:55:54.252
<v John Miller>that there is now a calculator library.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2148-0
01:56:04.532 --> 01:56:08.156
<v John Miller>You know,
maybe I haven't accepted it and then so</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2148-1
01:56:08.156 --> 01:56:12.722
<v John Miller>let's go ahead and accept that.
It's got rid of a bunch of the</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2148-2
01:56:12.722 --> 01:56:14.172
<v John Miller>implementation code.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2151-0
01:56:17.492 --> 01:56:23.532
<v John Miller>And left a comment there that we are
delegating evaluation to the new library.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2153-0
01:56:26.252 --> 01:56:30.597
<v John Miller>So that looks good.
Here's the new library,</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2153-1
01:56:30.597 --> 01:56:32.572
<v John Miller>the evaluator class.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2158-0
01:56:38.172 --> 01:56:45.143
<v John Miller>And changes to the unit test are now
calling the calculator evaluator instead</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2158-1
01:56:45.143 --> 01:56:48.092
<v John Miller>of the just a inline calculation.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2160-0
01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:54.092
<v John Miller>So that looks good. That looks good.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2161-0
01:56:58.492 --> 01:56:58.812
<v John Miller>So.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2164-0
01:57:01.492 --> 01:57:04.492
<v John Miller>So next steps add more unit tests for
corner cases.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2165-0
01:57:06.932 --> 01:57:09.172
<v John Miller>So we can say go ahead and do that.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2176-0
01:57:24.452 --> 01:57:27.116
<v John Miller>All right. Well,
it's time to take a break.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2176-1
01:57:27.116 --> 01:57:30.568
<v John Miller>So why don't we do that?
We'll take a break for an hour.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2176-2
01:57:30.568 --> 01:57:34.080
<v John Miller>When we come back,
we'll take a look at the code that was</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2176-3
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:37.532
<v John Miller>changed and then we'll pick up where we
left off. Great.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2174-0
01:57:38.572 --> 01:57:38.972
<v Majernik, Peter>Thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2177-0
01:57:39.572 --> 01:57:40.212
Thank you.

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2178-0
01:57:41.092 --> 01:57:41.932
<v John Miller>You're welcome. Thank you.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2304-0
02:03:15.732 --> 02:03:17.332
<v John Miller>Go outside.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2308-0
02:03:29.812 --> 02:03:29.972
<v John Miller>8.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2327-0
02:04:32.532 --> 02:04:33.372
<v John Miller>Yeah.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2328-0
02:04:35.932 --> 02:04:36.572
<v John Miller>OK.</v>

8cffbb5f-e189-464a-a074-f76d1d96db5f/2377-0

<v John Miller>OK.</v>
