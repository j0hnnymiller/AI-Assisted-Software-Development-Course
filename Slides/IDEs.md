| IDE / Editor | Built‑In AI Features | Supported AI Assistants | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **VS Code** | Deep AI integration through extensions; increasingly AI‑first workflows | GitHub Copilot, Cline, ChatGPT‑based extensions, Gemini integrations | Extremely flexible; huge ecosystem; top-tier AI support; widely adopted | Requires extension management; quality varies by plugin |
| **Visual Studio (Windows)** | Native GitHub Copilot integration; AI‑powered IntelliCode | GitHub Copilot, IntelliCode | Strong enterprise + .NET support; excellent refactoring and debugging | Less flexible than VS Code for non‑Microsoft stacks |
| **JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.)** | JetBrains AI Assistant; code completion, refactoring, doc generation | JetBrains AI Assistant, GitHub Copilot | Deep static analysis + AI; strong multi‑language support | JetBrains AI Assistant is subscription‑based; Copilot integration not as seamless |
| **Cursor IDE** | AI‑first editor; conversational coding; multi‑file reasoning | Built‑in AI models (GPT‑based, Claude‑based), Copilot alternatives | Designed for AI pair‑programming; strong repo‑wide reasoning | Not a traditional IDE; still maturing for large enterprise workflows |
| **Replit** | AI‑powered Ghostwriter for code generation, debugging, and explanations | Ghostwriter | Great for beginners and rapid prototyping; browser‑based | Less powerful for large, multi‑module projects |
| **Builder.io / Builder Code Editor** | AI‑enhanced coding environment with integrated assistants | Multiple AI integrations depending on setup | Strong web‑dev focus; modern AI‑native UX | Not a general‑purpose IDE |
| **Code‑B Editors (AI‑enhanced editors)** | Predictive code generation, debugging, and review | Multiple AI models depending on configuration | Strong AI‑centric workflows; optimized for speed | Less mainstream; smaller ecosystem |
