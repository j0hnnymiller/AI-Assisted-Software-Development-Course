# 🌐 AI-Assisted Evergreen Development
### Brownfield → Evergreen with Copilot
John Michael Miller · Code Staffing

<!-- _speaker: (0–2 min) Welcome participants, introduce yourself, set context for webinar. -->

---

## 🎯 Webinar Goal
- Show how AI can help move from **legacy (brownfield)** to **evergreen** code
- Share practical workflows, guardrails, and mindset
- Inspire confidence in using Copilot effectively

<!-- _speaker: (2–4 min) Explain the purpose of the session and what attendees will gain. -->

---

## Agenda
1. Welcome & Context  
2. Core Concepts: Legacy vs Evergreen  
3. Managing AI Assistance  
4. Evergreen Practices  
5. Demo (Optional)  
6. Wrap-Up & Q&A  

<!-- _speaker: (4–5 min) Walk through agenda quickly, reassure participants about flow. -->

---

## 👋 Welcome & Context
- Legacy code is everywhere  
- Evergreen code resists technical debt  
- AI can accelerate transformation — if managed well  

<!-- _speaker: (5–7 min) Frame the challenge: legacy vs evergreen, why AI matters now. -->

---

## 🏗️ What is Legacy Code?
- Not greenfield, not evergreen  
- Codebases degrade over time due to:  
  - Technology shifts  
  - Practices & people  
  - Business rules & workflows  
  - Architecture changes  

<!-- _speaker: (7–10 min) Define legacy code clearly, give relatable examples. -->

---

## 🌱 What is Evergreen Code?
- Actively resists technical debt  
- Secure, releasable, maintainable  
- If rewritten today, it would look the same  
- Evergreen is the **goal state**  

<!-- _speaker: (10–13 min) Contrast evergreen with legacy, emphasize aspirational nature. -->

---

## 💡 Respect Legacy Code
- It works — don’t break it  
- Tested by users in production  
- “You get what you get and you don’t throw a fit”  

<!-- _speaker: (13–15 min) Light moment: legacy code deserves respect, not fear. -->

---

## ⚙️ Managing AI Assistance
- Treat Copilot as a **junior developer**  
- Clear instructions + careful review = success  
- Strategies before engaging AI:  
  - Rollback plan  
  - Testing confidence  
  - Peer/AI/static reviews  
  - Small, incremental changes  

<!-- _speaker: (15–20 min) Explain Copilot management, emphasize guardrails and discipline. -->

---

## 🧩 Context Management
- Importance of context: too little vs too much  
- Prompt design: short, modular, step-by-step  
- Instruction files: project rules, standards, practices  
- Custom chat modes for productivity  

<!-- _speaker: (20–23 min) Share practical prompt engineering tips, keep examples simple. -->

---

## 🛡️ Evergreen Practices
- Automate dependency updates (Dependabot, SCA)  
- Merge small, frequent changes  
- Pin & monitor dependencies  
- CI checklist: green build, security review, changelog  

<!-- _speaker: (23–27 min) Highlight evergreen checklist, connect to real-world workflows. -->

---

## 🧰 Safety Nets
- Linting + AI-assisted rules  
- Test automation: unit, integration, E2E  
- Generate tests with Copilot  
- Review with multiple models  

<!-- _speaker: (27–30 min) Stress importance of safety nets, testing, and validation. -->

---

## 🖥️ Demo (Optional)
- Fork a small legacy repo  
- Use Copilot to:  
  - Generate documentation or tests  
  - Compare implementations with two models  
- Show workflow, not full exercise  

<!-- _speaker: (30–35 min) Quick demo — keep lightweight, focus on illustrating workflow not details. -->

---

- GitHub Universe: [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com)  
- Blog: [codemag.com/blog/AIPractitioner](https://codemag.com/blog/AIPractitioner)  

<!-- _speaker: (35–37 min) Share resources, encourage further learning. -->

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Legacy → Evergreen is a mindset shift  
- Copilot amplifies good practices, needs guardrails  
- Instruction files + automation = resilience  
- Small changes, frequent validation  

<!-- _speaker: (37–40 min) Summarize key points, reinforce main message. -->

---

## 🙋 Wrap-Up & Q&A
- Review outcomes  
- Address questions  
- Next steps: try forking a repo and applying one evergreen practice
