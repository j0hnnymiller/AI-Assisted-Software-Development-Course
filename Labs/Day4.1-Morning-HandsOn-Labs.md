## Greenfield Development with AI Assistance

---

## Lab Overview

These hands-on labs are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the Day 4 Morning Session, focusing on Greenfield development using AI assistance, vertical slice architecture, conceptual modeling with ORM, and systematic prompt-based development workflows.

---

## Lab 1: GitHub Actions Workflow with Prompt Execution (45 minutes)

### Objective

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that executes a prompt on pull requests to validate code style and business rules.

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with code
- Access to OpenAI API or GitHub Copilot CLI
- Understanding of GitHub Actions and workflows

### Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Set Up the Style Check Script

1. Create a Python script `style-checker.py` that:

   - Accepts an instruction/prompt file as input
   - Reads changed files from a pull request
   - Uses an AI API (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or GitHub Copilot) to analyze code
   - Returns style violations in a structured format

2. Configure your script to support multiple AI providers:
   - OpenAI API
   - Azure OpenAI
   - GitHub Copilot CLI (gh copilot suggest)

**Hint**: Remember the lesson learned - the GitHub Copilot CLI's `suggest` command is designed for interactive command suggestions, not structured data analysis. Use the API approach instead.

#### Task 1.2: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Create `.github/workflows/style-check.yml`
2. Configure the workflow to:

   - Trigger on pull request events
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., OpenAI SDK)
   - Run the style checker script
   - Post results as a PR comment

3. Add the required API key as a GitHub Secret:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent for your chosen provider)

#### Task 1.3: Create an Instruction File

1. Create `.github/prompts/style-guidelines.md` with:
   - Coding standards for your language
   - Naming conventions
   - Specific style rules to check

#### Task 1.4: Test the Workflow

1. Create a test file with intentional style violations:

   - Incorrect naming conventions
   - Missing documentation
   - Improper indentation
   - Hardcoded values that should be constants

2. Create a pull request with these violations
3. Verify the workflow:
   - Executes successfully
   - Identifies violations
   - Posts a detailed comment on the PR

### Deliverables

- Working GitHub Actions workflow
- Style checker script supporting at least one AI provider
- Instruction file with style guidelines
- Screenshot of PR comment showing detected violations

### Bonus Challenge

- Implement support for Azure DevOps pipelines instead of GitHub Actions
- Add severity levels to violations (error, warning, suggestion)
- Create a custom action that can be reused across repositories

## Lab 3: Conceptual Modeling with ORM Diagrams (45 minutes)

### Objective

Create an Object-Role Model (ORM) diagram to define business rules and use it to generate implementation artifacts with AI assistance.

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of business domain modeling
- Basic knowledge of entity relationships
- Access to a diagramming tool or text-based modeling

### Background

ORM (Object-Role Modeling) provides a formal, graphical way to capture business rules and constraints that is both human-readable and machine-processable.

### Tasks

#### Task 3.1: Create a Simple ORM Model

Choose a simple domain (e.g., library system, course enrollment, project management) and create an ORM model that includes:

1. **Entities** (at least 3):

   - Students, Courses, Enrollments
   - OR: Books, Authors, Borrowers
   - OR: Your own domain

2. **Facts/Predicates** showing relationships:

   - "Student is enrolled in Course"
   - "Student has StudentID"
   - "Course has maximum enrollment"

3. **Constraints**:

   - **Uniqueness constraints**: bars indicating which roles uniquely identify instances
   - **Mandatory constraints**: dots showing required relationships
   - **Exclusion constraints**: XOR relationships
   - **Value constraints**: allowed values for specific roles

4. **Subtyping** (if applicable):
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Subtype constraints

#### Task 3.2: Verbalize Your Model

1. Write out the natural language statements for each fact:

   - "Each Student is enrolled in zero or more Courses"
   - "Each Course has exactly one maximum enrollment count"

2. Document all constraints in plain English:
   - "A student cannot audit a course they are enrolled in"
   - "An instructor must work for the department they head"

#### Task 3.3: Generate Implementation Using AI

Using your ORM model as context:

1. Create a prompt file that includes:

   - The verbalized business rules
   - Entity definitions
   - Constraint descriptions

2. Ask AI to generate:

   - Database schema (SQL or NoSQL)
   - Entity classes/models
   - Validation logic for constraints
   - Repository interfaces

3. Review the generated code for:
   - Correct implementation of constraints
   - Proper relationship modeling
   - Business rule enforcement

#### Task 3.4: Create Instruction Files from ORM

1. Create `business-rules-to-vertical-slices.instructions.md`:

   - How to interpret ORM entities as features
   - How to enforce constraints in validation logic
   - How to implement relationships

2. Create specific prompts for:
   - Database schema generation
   - Entity class generation
   - Use case implementation

### Deliverables

- ORM diagram (can be hand-drawn/scanned, or digital)
- Natural language verbalization document
- Generated code artifacts (schema, entities, validators)
- Instruction files for future use

### Bonus Challenge

- Use NORMA extension in Visual Studio to create formal ORM models
- Generate multiple technology implementations (e.g., SQL, MongoDB, Neo4j)
- Create test cases directly from ORM constraints

### Workflow Tips

**Prompting Strategy**:

1. Start with: "Using the instruction files in this repository, create a [feature name] feature"
2. Reference specific business rules: "This feature must enforce the constraint that..."
3. Request specific artifacts: "Generate the Command, Handler, Validator, and Repository for..."
4. For UI: "Create a [framework] component that calls the [endpoint] API"

**Debugging Strategy**:

1. Run application frequently
2. Check both frontend console and backend logs
3. Copy entire error messages to AI
4. Ask: "I'm seeing this error: [paste]. What changes are needed?"
5. If the error is frontend-related but caused by backend, ask AI to "create a prompt for investigating this on the backend"

**Simple Browser Technique**:

1. Open app in VS Code Simple Browser
2. Use "Add element to chat" to select UI elements
3. Request specific UI changes: "Add more spacing between these elements"
4. Use continuous selection for complex UI regions

### Tasks

#### Task 5.1: Split Your Application

1. Separate your application into two repositories:

   - Frontend repository
   - Backend API repository

2. Update instruction files for each:
   - Backend focuses on API patterns, data models, business rules
   - Frontend focuses on UI patterns, state management, API integration

#### Task 5.2: Cross-Repository Debugging

1. Introduce an intentional mismatch:

   - Change an API endpoint path in backend
   - Keep old path in frontend

2. Run the application and capture frontend error

3. Use AI to generate a cross-repository prompt:
   - In frontend chat: "Create a detailed prompt for the backend team to investigate this API error"
   - Copy that prompt to backend chat
   - Let AI in backend repo identify and fix the issue

#### Task 5.3: Coordinated Feature Development

1. Plan a new feature that requires changes in both repositories
2. Create prompts for both sides:
   - Backend: API endpoint requirements
