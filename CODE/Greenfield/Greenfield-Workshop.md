Workshop 2: Greenfield Development with Copilot and VS Code
Abstract
This one‑day workshop explores how GitHub Copilot and VS Code's AI-assisted development environment can accelerate greenfield development, starting from scratch and building new applications with sustainable practices from the outset. Attendees will work in interactive, attendee‑led sessions to design instruction files, prompt files, and custom chatmodes that guide GitHub Copilot and VS Code through requirements gathering, planning, and implementation.
The workshop emphasizes vertical slicing as a strategy to speed development and improve feedback loops. Participants will:
- Generate detailed requirements and implementation plans using GitHub Copilot's code generation and VS Code's integrated AI capabilities.
-Use custom chatmodes (e.g., Code Reviewer, Security Analyst, Architect, Test Engineer) within VS Code to guide design and coding decisions.
- Implement features slice‑by‑slice using Copilot's intelligent code suggestions, validating business rules and technical choices along the way.
- Compare outputs from multiple AI models to understand bias and improve reliability.
By the end of the day, attendees will have experienced how to launch a greenfield project from scratch using GitHub Copilot and VS Code's AI‑assisted workflows, delivering working increments quickly while maintaining quality and adaptability through intelligent development practices.
