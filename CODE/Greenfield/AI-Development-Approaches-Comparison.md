## AI Development Approaches Overview

### Three Primary Methods for Guiding AI Assistance

1. **Instruction Files** → Persistent behavioral guidelines
2. **Prompt Files** → Executable task templates
3. **Custom Chat Modes** → Specialized conversational contexts

Each serves different purposes in the AI-assisted workflow

---

# Instruction Files

## Persistent AI Behavioral Guidelines

---

## What Are Instruction Files?

### Definition

- **Persistent configuration files** that define AI behavior patterns
- Applied automatically across multiple interactions
- Establish consistent working standards and constraints

### Key Characteristics

- **Scope**: Repository-wide or context-specific
- **Persistence**: Active across all relevant AI interactions
- **Purpose**: Define "how" AI should work, not "what" to do

---

## Instruction File Structure

```markdown
---
description: Azure best practices for AI development
applyTo: "**" # File pattern scope
---

# Core Instructions

- Use Azure Tools when handling Azure requests
- Follow security best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Generate comprehensive documentation

# Code Generation Rules

- Write tests before implementation
- Use dependency injection patterns
- Follow naming conventions
- Include proper logging
```

---

## Instruction Files: Use Cases

### Perfect For:

- **Coding Standards** → Consistent style across projects
- **Security Policies** → Enforce security practices
- **Quality Gates** → Define testing and review requirements
- **Technology Constraints** → Specify approved frameworks/tools

### Examples:

- `azure-development.instructions.md`
- `testing-standards.instructions.md`
- `security-requirements.instructions.md`

- Contain detailed instructions for particular objectives
- Designed for execution in AI chat interfaces

### Key Characteristics

- **Scope**: Single, focused task or workflow
- **Execution**: Run on-demand when needed
- **Purpose**: Define "what" to accomplish with specific steps

---

## Prompt File Structure

```yaml
---
mode: agent
model: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet@2024-10-22"
tools: ["create", "edit", "read"]
description: Generate comprehensive API documentation
prompt_metadata:
  id: generate-api-docs
  title: API Documentation Generator
  category: documentation
  output_format: markdown
---

# Generate API Documentation

## Context
Create comprehensive API documentation from code analysis...

## Requirements
1. Analyze existing API endpoints
2. Generate OpenAPI specifications
3. Create developer-friendly guides
4. Include example requests/responses

```

---

## Prompt Files: Use Cases

### Perfect For:

- **Code Generation** → Create specific components/features
- **Documentation** → Generate standardized docs
- **Analysis Tasks** → Code reviews, security audits
- **Refactoring** → Structured code improvements

### Examples:

- `implement-user-authentication.prompt.md`

- `create-deployment-pipeline.prompt.md`

---

# Custom Chat Modes

## Specialized Conversational Contexts

---

## What Are Custom Chat Modes?

### Definition

- **Preconfigured AI personalities** for specific domains
- Combine behavioral rules with specialized knowledge
- Provide contextual expertise for particular scenarios

### Key Characteristics

- **Scope**: Domain or role-specific interactions
- **Context**: Rich background knowledge and constraints
- **Purpose**: Act as specialized "AI expert" for conversations

---

## Custom Chat Mode Examples

### DevOps Engineer Mode

```yaml
role: "Senior DevOps Engineer"
expertise:
  - CI/CD pipelines
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - Container orchestration
  - Monitoring and observability

behavior:
  - Focus on scalability and reliability
  - Recommend industry best practices
  - Consider security implications
  - Suggest automation opportunities
```

---

## Custom Chat Modes: Use Cases

### Perfect For:

- **Domain Expertise** → Get specialized knowledge
- **Role-Playing** → AI acts as specific professional
- **Context Switching** → Different perspectives on same problem
- **Learning** → Educational conversations with expert personas

### Examples:

- **Security Architect Mode** → Focus on security concerns
- **Database Expert Mode** → Optimize data architecture
- **UX Designer Mode** → Human-centered design guidance
